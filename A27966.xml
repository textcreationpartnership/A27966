            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap> worth, may argue ſomewhat of preſumption; but to be intirely wanting in thoſe reſpects, ſo much your due, is a more conſiderable fault.</p>
            <p>It was not without relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance, that I conſented to put this little Treatiſe under your ſafe-guard: Not that I
<pb facs="tcp:108454:3"/>queſtion'd the influence of your Name; but leaſt the ſlender value of the thing ſhould lead a contempt from you to the Author.</p>
            <p>But then I conſider'd, that although you would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover the meanneſs of this attempt, yet you were endued with a ſufficient ſhare of goodneſs, not to miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the honeſt end; The firſt oppoſed my growing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to make you the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron hereof: the laſt adviſed me to go on, as being incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with cenſure, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
            <p>You are ingaged, Sir, in an eſpecial manner to the
<pb facs="tcp:108454:3"/>Office of pardoning, as well upon the account of your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from our inferiour Orb, as in regard to the fair endowments of your mind: both implying good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a conſpicuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
            <p>As to my Author, I durſt venture to aſſert, that he has manag'd himſelf like a man of Honeſty and Parts, that his arguments are as material and perſuaſive as the Subject will bear, and if any thing renders him of leſs value, 'tis the ill performance of the Tranſlation, which, I believe, is made worſe by the miſtakes of the Printer.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:108454:4"/>
            <p> I can eaſily foreſee, that it will be condemned by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious part of the world, but ſince the wiſer men muſt infallibly commend the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, I am little concerned at what the Fop ſhall declare againſt it.</p>
            <p>It has been always matter of great wonder to me, that men ſhould be ſo generally incenſed at and averſe to Marriage, when thoſe men without it had been the moſt diſgracefull part of Human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: the very name of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard implying Contumely and Diſorder.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Deſign not, Reader, to tell you all the advantages of this Book. You will ſufficiently diſcover them, when you read it. I hope you will not find it altogether unworthy of your eſteem, if you judge of it without prejudice. You will learn in it the art of fearing God, and to be an honeſt Man; to avoid the irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of a licentious life, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the vertues of a Chriſtian life. This is its general aim. And what follows its particular. It endeavours to inſpire you with the love of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. It makes appear that there is nothing in the World more excellent, or more neceſſary, than this holy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. It opens to you an eaſie way to enter it advantagiouſly. It fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes you with means to make it
<pb facs="tcp:108454:6"/>an eternal Spring of lawful pleaſures and to partake of them with ſo much the more ſatisfaction, as they are pure and innocent. In a word i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> affords you precepts to ſpeak well and to make a true judgment of Ladies; that is to ſay, what you naturally love the moſt, and whom ever the Laws of civility oblige you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
            <p>You will without doubt applaud the uſefulneſs of the deſign, but the difficulty of executing it well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. I promiſe you nothing on its part, but what it gives you, if you will receive it. Happy, if its method pleaſes you, and you approve of the Stile! I have endeavour'd to make my Subject as agreeable as I could, and as little tireſome. To this purpoſe I have even ſeaſoned my diſcourſe with divers ſentences of ancient Authors of the World and Church, Holy and Prophane. Never was matter more ſuſceptible
<pb facs="tcp:108454:6"/>of this mixture, than that of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and it is a Liberty which ought to be pardoned me in this place, though it were not allowable in any thing elſe. The neceſſity I was under oftentimes to relate paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, which might in our language offend tender ears, is one of the forcible reaſons that has the moſt obliged me to imploy more than one to expreſs my thought. But I can aſſure thoſe, who are unacquainted with it, that it renders not the reading of this Book the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful. One may paſs beyond with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption. The connexion and the ſenſe will not ceaſe to appear.</p>
            <p>I ſhall mark one thing more. You will, perhaps, be ſurpriſed to ſee that I apply to Batchelors alone the neceſſity of Marrying, as if it referred only to them, and that Maids had no ſhare in it. But you will apprehend, I aſſure my ſelf, without my telling you, ſo that in
<pb facs="tcp:108454:7"/>ſpeaking to one, I likewiſe deſigne to ſpeak to the reſt. The two Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are under an equal neceſſity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

One obſerves one thing in it, but one finds another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly different. It is remarked of the Temples of ancient <hi>Egypt,</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more magnificent without, nor more barbarous within. On the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108454:13"/>other ſide we read of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that under a mean co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of <hi>Goats</hi>-Skins, it contained the Ark of Alliance, the Mercy-Seat, the Altar of Gold, and a thouſand other precious things. This Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and not the other, is a very plain repreſentation of Marriage. If you conſider the ontſide of it, what can be more miſerable in appearance? One ſees nothing but difficulties. One muſt pleaſe a Wife. One muſt bring up Children. One muſt be mindful of a Family. One muſt paſs through a thouſand kinds of proofs. But if you examine its inward part, what ſweetneſs, what ſatisfaction, what delight ſhall you not diſcover for Man, ſince God reſides therein, and pours out the influence of his grace upon it? Nothing in nature can repreſent to us the felicity of a Marriage bleſt of Heaven, and poſſeſſed of the peace of the Holy-Spirit.</p>
            <p>I confeſs likewiſe that Marriage, as well all other humane conditions, is a compoſition of Good and Evil, of Sweets and Bitters, of Joy and Sorrow: it is not exempt from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108454:14"/>It has its Thorns, and its Tribulations: One may affirm it, 'tis true, <hi>In cadem urna, aurum eſt,</hi>

            <p>The life of Man, according to <hi>Job,</hi> is a train of continual War, and <hi>Moſes</hi> informs us, that the faireſt of his days is a ſort of puniſhment. Put him in what ſcituation you pleaſe, he will never be entirely compoſed. He will always complain: He may torment himſelf long enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a real happineſs; but he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find it in this world.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108454:14"/>Afflictions will proceed to him out of his own repoſe, and croſſes from the very ſource of pleaſures; as <hi>Lucretius</hi> ſo well obſerves.</p>

            <p>I ſay in the ſecond place, that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is that of all the conditions of Man, the moſt proper to ſupport croſſes. A Batchelour cannot ſhare them with any body: He muſt foment and digeſt them all entire in his own breaſt. It is in this proſpect, that the Wiſe Man pronounces unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him that is alone. If he falls down, ſays he, who ſhall raiſe him up? I add, if he be afflicted; who ſhall comfort him? If he be indiſpoſed, who ſhall take care of him? If his heart be charged with what is called <hi>gravamen mentis,</hi> who ſhall give him eaſe? Whom ſhall he entruſt with the ſecret of his grief? In what Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom ſhall he pour forth his ſighs? One ſays that a good thing poſſeſſed alone, is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.<note place="margin">Sen. Ep. <hi>6.</hi>

            <p>It is directly otherwiſe of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Man. He has an aſſiſtant. He has a companion. He has another ſelf, that enters into his heart; that partakes of all that happens to him; that is touched with all his diſaſters; and doth all that lies in her power to ſweeten his mind. <hi>Scio Spiritus illjus in meo verti,</hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xor marito, in malis aut morbis affecto, ſuaviſſima eſt. Iram mitigat, &amp; a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia animum avertit.</hi> There is nothing that comes near to the aſſiſtance he receives from her in the moſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome occaſions of life.</p>
            <p>In a word, when I ſpeak of the excellence of Marriage, I pretend to conſider it as it is in it ſelf; and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108454:15"/>not as it may be in its conſequences. One muſt diſtinguiſh between what is proper to it, and what is accidental. By nature it has nothing but what's good, and may render a man happy. But if it becomes fatal to him, and he finds in it nothing but Thorns, it is through his own fault; Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age it ſelf is free from that guilt. It is not impoſſible, if he will, to make of it a ſource of pleaſures to himſelf, and to make it ſerve advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſly to the greateſt of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, which is Salvation, as I will demonſtrate in the latter parts of this work.</p>
            <p>To underſtand this well, one muſt conſider Marriage in a threefold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. In relation to God, who is the Author of it. In relation to Man, for whom it was inſtituted; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the World, to which it is a perpetual principle of ſubſiſtance. In theſe three reſpects one may ſay that there is nothing in nature of more excellence than Marriage.</p>
            <p>It is then from God, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from God, that this holy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety draws its original. He had no
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108454:16"/>ſooner taken Man from nothing, but he took out of Man the Woman for the ſake of Man. Scarce had he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated him, but he thought to marry him. <hi>It is not good, ſaid he,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.18.</note> 
               <hi>for Man to be alone.</hi> Let us make him an aſſiſtant, that may be like him: Thus he formed an <hi>Eve</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam himſelf, which is not without myſtery. Then he pronounced theſe words which are of an eternal obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to all men. <hi>Man ſhall leave his Father and his Mother and ſtick to his Wife, and they ſhall be two in one fleſh.</hi> Behold, Sir, the Inſtitution of Marriage, which is, you ſee, as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as the world. One can obſerve nothing ſince the Creation, that has preceeded it. It was the firſt care that God took after this great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-peice, ſo neceſſary did he eſteem it. It even ſeems to be in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a part of it, and that without it, it had been imperfect. You'll ſay that it was a quality, which Man wanted for his perfection, and that without it he had been unworthy to obtain an Empire over thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108454:16"/>which the Creator gave him. It was perhaps for this reaſon that the Jews termed a Batchelour, but half a man.</p>
            <p>How many Laws and humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions are there, which one eſteems not only for themſelves, but alſo for the ſake of their Authors? who will not acknowledge that it was a great happineſs for Philoſophy, to have been taught by <hi>Ariſtotle?</hi> And that the <hi>Socrates's</hi> and <hi>Cato's</hi> have done as much honour to Wiſdom, as Wiſdom has done them? who does not know like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that the Order of Knighthood ſo famous among Chriſtians is of it ſelf a very ſmall matter, and that it draws almoſt all its Dignity from the very inſtitution of Kings, who had a mind thereby to make a mark of diſtinction between the Lords of their Court?</p>
            <p>Upon this foot one may affirm that Marriage is a very conſiderable thing. There is here more than <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> more than <hi>Socrates,</hi> more than <hi>Cato,</hi> more than a mortal King, more than <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf the Author of the Law; In a word, more than all the Legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108454:17"/>together. Its Inſtitutor is God himſelf; that is to ſay the Maſter of the world; the Lord of Heaven and Earth; the King of Ages, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Eternity; Yes, Sir, Marriage is his production; It is the breath of his mouth; It is the work of his hands. It is the character of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. If the inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, as well as the thing it ſelf, makes us find in Baptiſm, and in the Euchariſt, a ſupernatural excellence; how ſhould one be wanting in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage by relation to the inſtitution of God? Behold then, Sir, the firſt degree of its excellence. <hi>viz.</hi> That it is of right divine. That it is of univerſal right. That it is of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual right. God has ordained it, God has eſtabliſht it. And he has ordained it for all men, and for all times. <hi>It is not good for Man to be alone. Let him forſake his Father and Mother, and joyn himſelf to a Wife:</hi> That not only relates to <hi>Adam,</hi> but to all his poſterity to the end of the world. What can be more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred than this Law? 'twas God that made it. What can be more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive?
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108454:17"/>it regards all humankind. What can be more durable? It ought to continue during the Revolution of all Ages.</p>
            <p>I introduce into the excellence of Marriage, that God has inſtituted it in the ſtate of Innocence, and in the Terreſtrial Paradiſe. In effe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks theſe two particulars ſhould extreamly advance the price of it. Undoubtedly there was nothing in that happy condition, wherein God had placed our firſt Parents, but what was very good, and participated of the purity of their original: They carried at that time, upon their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads the glorious Stamps of their Creator. Sin had not yet defaced in them that curious Image of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which he had communicated to them. Holy, and without defects, they enjoy'd a perfect felicity. All things conſpir'd to their happineſs. Who can diſagree then, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage whereof they were at this time in poſſeſſion; was in it ſelf, and of jts nature an excellent thing.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:108454:18"/>
            <p> Is it not alſo the conſequence, which follows from that place of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, wherein it was eſtabliſhed? When God gave his Laws to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he deſcended upon <hi>Sinai,</hi> where with teſtimonies of his Majeſty infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely glorious, he made his voice known to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and pronounced all thoſe divine Words, which inſpire veneration and fear. Thoſe terrible preparations wherein God appear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to the Jews, that ſounding of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, thoſe flaſhes of Lightning, and claps of Thunder, which overwhelmed the holy Mountain; which gave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment to <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf; and which made the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to cry out, <hi>We ſhall dye: for we have ſeen God.</hi> All this, I ſay, muſt without doubt contribute much to their receiving with veneration the Celeſtial Laws. They might reaſonably inferr, that what ſhould be directed to them from a place crowned with ſo much glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and magnificence muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</p>
            <p>What opinion likewiſe ſhould we not have of Marriage, when we ſee it proceed from a bed of Innocence,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108454:18"/>and a Paradiſe of delights? As ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and auguſt as <hi>Sinai</hi> was at the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the Law, yet I dare affirm that it was nothing in compariſon of that Garden of God, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Marriage therein. It was of that one might truly ſay, <hi>Introite, nam &amp; hic Dij ſunt.</hi> God was in it. God walked therein. God made it (that I may ſo ſpeak) his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of pleaſure. God familiarly talkt with Man therein. There was nothing, but what inſpired ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Rivers wherewith it was inceſſantly watered, were as ſo many currents of delights. Alll the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concurred to render it agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. It was not yet ſubject to the irregularities of Seaſons; the froſts of Winter, and heats of Summer, were never perceived there. It was crowned with a perpetual Spring. In a word there was nothing there, but what was proportioned to the perfection of their being, and the purity of their original; nothing, but what exactly agreed with the happy condition of innocent Man. <hi>Nathaniel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Philip,</hi> through a falſe prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſeſſion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108454:19"/>againſt <hi>Jeſus Chriſt: Can any thing that's good come out of</hi> Nazareth? Let us ſay on the other ſide, can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing thats bad come out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe? We often judge of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of things, and likewiſe of men by the places from whence they come. It ſhould be good; as we ſay of Fruit: for it comes from a good Soil. He muſt needs deſerve, we ſay of a perſon, whom we know on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his Family and Education, for he belongs to people of merit. He is of Noble Bloud. He comes from a good place. And what ſhould we not ſay of Marriage, that it muſt be of ſingular excellency, ſince we ſee it comes from the Center of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; from the Eden of God, and from God himſelf.</p>
            <p>Let us conſider it, in the ſecond place, with relation to Man for whom it was inſtituted. In morality one calls that a good, which agrees with our nature, and is proportion'd to the condition we are in. According to this definition, Marriage ought to be a conſiderable good. What can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agree with man, and more exactly relate to his neceſſities?</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:108454:19"/>
            <p> Man was made for Society. He is called by ſome an animal of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. He cannot live alone. Even thoſe who repair to ſolitude, repair to it with others: without that they would not ſurvive it long. There are but few of thoſe Hermits who incloſe themſelves alive in a Cave, as in a hideous Sepulcher, to be deprived of all ſort of converſation. I am even of opinion that the <hi>Chartreux</hi> would ſoon be weary of their condition, as holy, and as much eſteemed as it is, if they had not the liberty of being ſeen of their friends, and of converſing with them ſometimes in a week.</p>
            <p>There are but few who can practice that inſtruction:</p>

            <p>But, Sir, of all Societies, that of a Woman is undoubtedly what Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires with moſt ardency. Nature has given him I know not what inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to joyn himſelf with that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which makes him turn toward it all his thoughts, from the moment he diſcerns the uſe for which he was made. It has been ſaid, long ſince, That life is no value without Women.</p>

            <p>Nothing is more agreeable than this mixture of the two Sexes, and there wants no very great Reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Man, that one was really made for the other.</p>
            <p>Thoſe, who have the leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to Marriage, do not fail to love Women. Oftentimes they are even moſt enflamed, and would eſteem their condition to come behind that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108454:20"/>of Beaſts, if they were deprived of their ſight and converſation. After having ſaid much ill of them, they are conſtrained to acknowledge that it is an evil which one cannot be without, and that the privation of this evil would be an evil incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably greater. <hi>Mulieres ſunt malum, ſed tamen O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But be it as it will, pure and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect nature is deſirous of a ſucceſſor.

            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:108454:21"/>
            <p> Shall I enlarge yet, that Marriage is to Man, both an excellent reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to cure him of his Incontinence, and an admirable means to eaſe him in his domeſtick cares? Who is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that Man was born for one thing, and the Woman for another? that there are a thouſand ſorts of cares ſuitable to a Woman, and by no means decent for a Man? who knows not that the Man is ſubject to an infinite number of accidents and diſtempers? That in theſe occaſions no body is a fitter aſſiſtance to him than a Wife?

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108454:23"/>as the bond of the moſt perfect, moſt ſweet, and moſt wholſome of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conjunctions. And Secondly, as the exerciſe of the moſt lawful, moſt agreeable, and moſt abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the world.</p>
            <p>Nothing unqueſtionably is more perfect than this union, in reſpect to its ſubject, to its end, and to its manner. Marriage unites Man and Woman; that is to ſay, what there is of moſt excellent, and moſt perfect in the corporeal nature: what reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in it ſelf all the Beautys of this great Univerſe: what alone is of more value, than all the other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures together. In ſine, what by the underſtanding and reaſon, with which it is endowed to the excluſion of all other Creatures, has merited the glorious name of the Image of God.</p>
            <p>What do you imagine to be the firſt part of this ſubject? It is a Celeſtial Soul: It is an immortal Spirit, an angelical and immaterial Subſtance. It is a being, that partakes in ſome ſort of that of God himſelf. <hi>Seneca</hi> goes yet further. When he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108454:24"/>conſiders its excellency, he will have it to be God himſelf, who, that as I may ſay, is come to lodge within our bodies. <hi>Quid aliudvoces animam, niſi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sen. Ep. <hi>32.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>As to the Body, which is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part that Marriage unites in the Man and woman, we may affirm that as miſerable as it is in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to its ſubſtance, and to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious accidents to which it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it is notwithſtanding the moſt perfect and moſt excellent work of Nature, in reſpect of its compoſition; which, as the Pſalmiſt ſo ellegantly aſſerts, is all embroadery: of its aim, which is to ſerve as an organ to the Soul, and to be as it were its Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, <hi>Corpus eſt veſtimentum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimae,</hi> ſays, St. <hi>Chryſoſlom,</hi> The Body is the Garment of the Soul; and in a word of its uſe, which is to be imployed in the moſt noble, moſt neceſſary, and moſt important actions of life.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:108454:24"/>
            <p> Behold then the firſt perfection of Maraiage: <hi>viz.</hi> That it unites Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Souls; that it joynes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the two fineſt Creatures in the World; That it is a compoſition that is moſt rare and precious in the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of things. This kind of Union is ſeen no where elſe, nor in any other ſubject. The Conjunction of the Stars is a Union purely corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, the Copulation of Beaſts is a Union purely carnal. Fornication is a Union of Body without Soul: And Friendſhip, as ſtrong as it may be betwixt two friends, is notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a Union of Souls without Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. There is nothing but Marriage, that truly unites Bodies and Souls togather.</p>
            <p>Its ſecond perfection conſiſts in its end; which according to nature is to multiply men: according to grace is to encreaſe the number of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: and according to Nature and Grace to retain the Sexes in the bounds of Wiſdom, Modeſty, and Honeſty, in removing the diſorders of debauchery. What can be more worthy of God and Man, than this End?</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:108454:25"/>
            <p> I ſay, in the laſt place, that the manner of this Union likewiſe makes up one of its beauties. Marriage doth not only joyn the Bodies, it alſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites the Souls. 'Tis much, I confeſs, but there is ſtill ſomething incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably greater. It not only unites Bodies and Souls, but O ſurpriſing wonder! of two Bodies and two Souls, it makes one and the ſame Perſon. Man and Wife, ſays Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>are no more two, but one fleſh. Ariſtotle</hi> affirms of a real friendſhip, that it is a ſoul which inhabits in two Bodies. But the union of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is ſtill much more intimate. They are no more two Bodies, but one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Body, no more two Souls, but one ſingle Soul. They are no longer two Bodies tyed to one Soul: No long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er two Souls confounded in one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. 'Tis a ſomething, I know not what, which is not abſolutely one or t'other, but is more than both, and cannot be expreſſed.</p>
            <p>Poſſibly the Comick Poet thought of nothing leſs than to repreſent to us the wonder of this Union, when he made the diverting peice of his

They are not at all diſtinguiſhable. They are two in number, yet but one in action and movement. They always ſpeak by I, and not by We. They do not ſay, thou art there, and I am here; but I am there, I am here. <hi>Plautus</hi> expreſſes it in his Language with an emphaſis we cannot render in ours. <q>What you would perſuade me no body ever heard ſays <hi>Amphytrion</hi> to <hi>Soſia,</hi> that one man ſhould be at the ſame time in two different places.</q>

            <p>Nothing, I confeſs, is more Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral than theſe ways of ſpeaking, but it muſt be granted alſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better explains the nature of this ſtrict union that Marriage makes. There are no words that can exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſent it. One ought for that end to compoſe a new Grammar. One cannot ſpeak of it but in making Soleciſms, and in confounding the plural with the ſingular, and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular with the plural. They are no more two, but one fleſh, ſays God himſelf of Man and Woman. They are one in two perſons. They are but one perſon in two bodies. <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae duae,</hi> two Souls. <hi>Animus unus,</hi> one
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108454:26"/>mind. <hi>Idem Velle, idem nolle,</hi> and one will. There happens nothing to one, but what arrives to t'other. The Husband and the Wife feel the ſame things. They ſuffer the ſame evils. They enjoy the ſame good things. Grief and joy make the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in each of them. <hi>Morbo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinetur unus? Detinentur duo, Adverſa premunt unum? Senſus in utroque eſt, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trumque riſus, utrumque lachrymae. Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera laetaque tenent unum? tenent u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trumque</hi> As the Phylopher ſo well expreſſes in <hi>Seneca The ſame diſtempers and misfortunes reach both. If one laugh ſo doth the other, their tears are the ſame,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This is too ſtrong for a ſimple friendſhip: Such a one as this never appeared. Or if ſuch a one has been found, one muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe it to be more than a union of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. You know that another was practiſed frequently enough amongſt the Pagans, which might much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the making of ſuch friends, but which is ſo ſcandalous to nature, that you muſt be contented to read it in the firſt Chapter of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> without hearing it named.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:108454:27"/>
            <p> But, Sir, if you would be perfectly convinced that there is nothing in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more excellent than Marriage, you are only to look upon it with relation to the great myſteries it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents. The holy Spirit has made uſe of in a thouſand places in our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Scriptures to teſtifie to us the tenderneſs of the Father under the Law; and of the charity of the Son under the Goſpel. <hi>I will eſpouſe thee to me for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108454:27"/>Church. 'Tis thus the Sacred Authors repreſent to us that intimate union of the Faithful with the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Fleſh of Chriſt. 'Tis thus they inſinuate to us that profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of love we find in his heart. 'Tis thus they inſtru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> us how dear we are to him and it, as we ought to make our intereſts of his, ſo he never fails to make ours his own.</p>
            <p>The ancient Doctors have carried yet further, the perfection of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, when they conſidered it as the natural Image of the Hypoſtatick uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the two Natures in Chriſt. One muſt acknowledge in effect that nothing diſcovers to us better the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of this adorable myſtery. As we have ſeen, of one Man and one Woman Marriage makes but one and the ſame perſon: they are no more two, but one fleſh. From thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds this reaſoning of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that he who loves his Wife loves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The Son of God being alſo united to our Fleſh, is become the Son of Man. He doth not think it a point of uſurpation to make himſelf equal to God, and notwithſtanding
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108454:28"/>in uniting himſelf to us by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, he is become fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bone.

He is not only God, he is God-Man: but as in Marriage, the union which is made, as intimate as it is, yet deſtroys not the ſubſtance of the two parties which compoſe it, each preſerving its own with its eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial qualities: So the Hypoſtatick u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the two Natures in Chriſt confounds them not. The one is not abſolv'd by the other. The both ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in him after a diſtinct and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible manner, without any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their eſſential qualities.

            <p>In a word, the Ancients affirm of Marriage, that it is the Symbol of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108454:28"/>union of regenerate Souls with God. They are all in him, and he in all them. As he who joyns himſelf to a Wife, becomes one and the ſame body with her: So, ſays St. <hi>Paul,</hi>

            <p>To know its whole extent, and how far it goes, you need only to read the Song of Songs in the Bible: There you will perceive the Air, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſecrets of a certain plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which charms the heart, and tranſports the Soul in ſpight of it ſelf.

            <p>After having ſhewn you the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Marriage with relation to the advantage of its union, it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to make it appear to you with relation to the authority it confers. By nature we love to rule, and to be ſuperior. The deſign of making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves equal to God, is what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd our firſt Parents. One finds nothing ſo ſweet as the power of commanding others, and of being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd. The Sacred Author lets us know that the very Apoſtles diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted concerning precedence. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this Spirit of pre-eminence is born with us: and one may ſay that it is perhaps the firſt of our inclinations. How much then ought Men to eſteem Marriage, ſince it ſatisfies it in ſo agreeable a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?</p>
            <p>In effect, all cannot be Kings in a Monarchy. Dukes in an Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy. States and Lords in a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108454:33"/>Heaven beſtows this honour but on a few. Yet theſe for the moſt part marry, and are in a right to hope for Children. Thus, Sir, of all humane dominions, the paternal is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly moſt ancient and legitimate. 'Tis even that which has ſerved as a foundation to all others.</p>
            <p>Methinks there is not enough ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of this Soveraign authority of Fathers over their Children. There is not perhaps any thing in nature ſo pleaſant, or ſo admirable: What delight to ſee this people of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, ſubjected to your wills: Always diſpoſed to obey you: always zealous for your ſervice: always intereſſed for whatſoever has relation to you. Do you ſpeak? they reply to you. Do you not ſpeak? they remain in ſilence. Do you blame? they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive. Do you command? they are full of joy. Do you give directions? they obey. Do you prohibit? they abſtain. Do you make appear to them an angry countenance? they tremble and are frightned Do you diſcover one of good humour and love? you fill them with contentment. In a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108454:33"/>word, you do even what you pleaſe amongſt them. You are the Maſter of their good and evil deſtiny. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever demanding of you the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of your conduct in their reſpect, they ſuppoſe it always full of wiſdom, and they take a pride in a blind ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to it. As they are ſatisfied you can never do any thing to their prejudice, and that all your aim is but to procure their good: ſo they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver undertaking any thing againſt you, but on the other ſide they ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all they can to give you a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their reſpect, their zeal, and acknowledgment. In fine, there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was an authority more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or more abſolute than this. It is to a Father that this Verſe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal</hi> perfectly agrees, in relation to his Children.</p>

            </q>
            <p>You will alledge perhaps that the great number of Subjects which makes the felicity of other Governments, is the misfortune of this, becauſe it muſt needs be that all Children are not of the character I repreſent them. How many doth one ſee, that one would ſwear they were born only to be a perpetual torment to their Parents? If one believes <hi>Euripides, Amongſt a great multitude ſcarce will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a better man than his Father.</hi> And according to <hi>Sophocles. There are few better, but many worſe.</hi> I deny not the conſequence. It is but too true. Every place is full of ill-born Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and unhappy Fathers. But, Sir, in ſpight of this ancient Proverb, <hi>Heroum filij noxae,</hi> and whatever the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108454:34"/>Poets affirm, it muſt notwithſtanding be granted, that it is chiefly among the ſcum of the people that appear theſe unnatural Children, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe all the rights of Nature, and Grace of Heaven and Earth, like other <hi>Chams</hi> and other <hi>Abſaloms</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their ſacraligious hands, either to diſhonour or perſecute their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. This is rarely ſeen amongſt the generous ſort, and in Famalies well orderd. I add, that there are very few Fathers, who may not, if they will, enjoy with pleaſure that ſupream Authority, which God has given them over their Children. 'Tis a thing which depends only upon education, and the manner of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up.</p>
            <p>There are three things which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly favour this paternal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and may much contribute to render it agreeable and propitious. The firſt is, That Fathers do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves form their own Subjects, not only by the birth they take from them, but alſo by the education which they give them. They are in ſome ſort Maſters of their minds. Nature
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108454:35"/>puts them into their hands, like ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Tables, wherein is nothing as yet written. They may imprint on them ſuch Maxims, as they think fit. They find there no reſiſtance. They receive the propenſity they would give them without any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>

            <p>Inſomuch that it depends only on them to teach them the art of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying and reſpecting. They alone have the power to make them wiſe.

            <p>For that end you want no ſtore of Rhetorick. There needs but your own proper example. All Children in general are pleaſed to imitate their Fathers, and to do all they ſee them practiſe. They copy them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally in their way of action, in their manners, and oftentimes in their very geſtures. <hi>Amat unuſquiſque ſequi vitum parentum,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Ambroſe. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perator ſilius quae viderit patrem facient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em,</hi> ſays likewiſe St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Thus nothing is more important for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren than example. But nothing alſo is more commodious for Fathers, who are capable of affording good ones. They may by this means ſave an infinite number of words and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes. If we believe St <hi>Bernard,</hi> Example is the beſt of Sermons. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movivus &amp; efficax exomplum operis eſt.</hi> And after <hi>Seneca,</hi> there is no ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108454:36"/>road to virtue, <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum iter eſt per praecepta:</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>breve &amp; efficax per exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</hi> Lorg is the way by Precepts, ſhort and efficacious by Examples.</p>
            <p>The ſecond advantage of this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, whereof I ſpeak, is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the hope, which all Subjects entertain of holding one day or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame place their Fathers do, and of becoming in their turn the Kings of their Children. Therefore if they have never ſo ſmall a ſtock of reaſon, they will take care to practice towards their Fathers thoſe duties, which they would be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſee unpractiſed towards them, when they ſhould poſſeſs the throne of Paternity, if one may be allowed to ſpeak ſo. If we love to imitate our Fathers, we do not leſs love to be traced of our Children. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly for their intereſts to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit themſelves religiouſly towards us of that obedience, ſubmiſſion, and profound reſpect, which even nature dictates to them, and not to eſtabliſh Maxims repugnant thereto, becauſe they will eſtabliſh them againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108454:36"/>For the moſt part one is long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Father than Child, and ſo were not theſe Duties, as they are, the juſteſt in the world, by a principle of Self-love there is not a Child but ought to hold them ſacred.</p>
            <p>Would you know what I call the third advantage of this authority of the Father over his Children? It is, that he exerciſes it continually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their eyes. It is, that he alone propoſes to himſelf their good. It is, that he labours only for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement. This is his general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. This is his principal end. This is his ſingle proſpect. Muſt not Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren become very ungrateful, not to honour and reſpect with all their power thoſe Fathers, who undergo ſuch pains of body and mind, and who ſweat in their ſight even bloud and water, in order to render their condition happy, and to leave them a good fortune? All have not ſucceſs, 'tis true: <hi>Non licet omnibus adire Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthum.</hi> But, be it as it will, all have the intention. All tend that way. All propoſe it to themſelves. Are you not of opinion, Sir, that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108454:37"/>there would be even more blindneſs than ingratitude in Children, that refuſe to ſubmit themſelves to this reaſonable dominion, ſince it has been eſtabliſhed by nature, and ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended by God himſelf in his Divine Scriptures, purely for their Salvation: and that it intirely aims at their proper good?</p>
            <p>Behold three Characters, that are peculiar to paternal goverment, and which diſtinguiſh it extreamly from all others. Who can diſpute after this the ſweetneſs of it? In effect, nothing is more. But it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough conſidered. I maintain that it is one of thoſe things, which may moſt aleviate the cares and troubles of a Father. What pleaſure is it, once again, to have Children, who like ſo many faithfull Subjects are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you for your guard, to ſerve you, to love you, to reſpect you. What ſatisfaction to be able at all times and in all things to rely upon their heart, their faith, and their zeal! What contentment never to impoſe but ſuch commands, as they readily perform, to ſay to one go,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108454:37"/>and he goes; to bid another do this, and he does it! What ſecret joy to obſerve all theſe other-ſelves, theſe verdant plants, theſe riſing Stars, which God has brought forth in your own boſom, to envy one another in the concern of your welfare! In a word, what extream bliſs to have always at one's table and about one ſuch a troop of real friends, uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Servants, and ſubmiſſive Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects! If one regarded things as they are, where are the bitters that all this is not capable of ſweetning? where are the misfortunes, that the proſpect of this good would not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate? And yet 'tis Marriage that produces all this ſatisfaction for man. 'Tis that which procures him all theſe advantages. It is by that Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, that God diſtributes to him all theſe favours. By conſequence what can one apprehend of more uſe to him? What can be more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
            <p>One affirms of truth, that it is what all the world believes. I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert juſt the ſame of an excellent thing, it is what all the world makes
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:108454:38"/>practice of. According to this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple one may ſay in a certain ſenſe, that nothing can be more excellent than Marriage. It is of univerſal practice. As I have already inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, a perpetual Celibacy was never eſteemed in the world. At all times it has been regarded as a thing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful to mankind, and as the Peſt of Republicks. The <hi>Romans</hi> depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Batchelours of Teſtamentary Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies. The <hi>Corinthians,</hi> of Burial. The <hi>Argives,</hi> of all ſorts of Preſents. And the <hi>Athenians</hi> even carried their ſeverity ſo far as to whip them before their Alters upon their ſolemn Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, if Marriage is of all times and of all places, one may ſay that it is likewiſe of all perſons. Birth, Death, and Marriage are the three bounds where all men meet. All are born: all dye, and almoſt all are married. Little and Great: Rich and Poor. Kings and Shepherds. Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Ignorant. Civilized and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians. Philoſophers and Orators. Young and Old. All kinds of Men. Of all kind of profeſſions. Of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108454:38"/>Of all Statures. Of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions. All Marry. All enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this great Society. All get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves admitted into the Brotherhood. There is no condition in the world, where one has ſo many companions. Methinks this ought to render it yet very conſiderable. But as nothing makes a virtue appear more ſplendid, than to compare it with its oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite vice; to ſhew more fully the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Marriage; is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the infamy of inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, its contrary, which is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Second Part of this Work.</p>

            <head>OF THE INFAMY OF <hi>Incontinence.</hi> PART. II.</head>
            <p>IF I was only to treat with Saints upon this Subject, I ſhould not have occaſion to uſe many words in order to perſuade them, that nothing is more infamous than Incontinence. To convince them hereof, it would be ſufficient to tell them, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more repugnant to that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108454:39"/>which they profeſs. But, Sir, it is with Sinners and great ones too, that I muſt have to do. Even with ſuch, who for the moſt part are grown old in criminal habits, and who make a ſport of that filthy debauchery, for which Heaven declares ſo much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence.</p>
            <p>You apprehend that if they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of the charms of Marriage, they are no leſs of the horrors of Luſt, and that it is equally difficult to convince them of the excellency of the one, and the infamy of the other: They are a ſort of people willful in their blindneſs. They reſolve to ſee nothing in the firſt but what is irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, in order to make it an object of Contempt. They refuſe to ſee any thing in the ſecond but what's agreeable, in order to make that a continual object of Concupiſence.</p>
            <p>This diſorder is even ſo common, ſo general, and ſo well fixed in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, that to undertake to withdraw men from it, and to exhort them to return from an errour, which it is much more eaſie to Blame than avoid, is in ſome ſort to make himſelf ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous;

            <p>'Tis certain that there is within an apparent ſweetneſs. One may affirm of Luſt, that it is the boſom of the voluptuouſneſs of the ſences, where ſinners take their ſleep with pleaſure.

            <p>All this is moſt true. Experience proves it every day in an inconteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, and yet men will not refrain this evil conduct.

            <p>Place, Sir, in the firſt rank all thoſe Libertines of Profeſſion. All thoſe Epecureans.

As if this very nature, which has conſin'd our inclination to the other Sex, and which for the propogation of Man-kind makes us ardently co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet the ſame, had not given us a reaſon to diſcern good and evil, and to rule our deſires. As if ſhe had not placed in our minds impreſſions of ſhame, which are not to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced without ceaſing to be Man. As if one of her firſt Leſſons, which ſhe gives us, was not temperence and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety.

            <p>The offenders of the ſecond order are unqueſtionably very culpable, but they are, I confeſs, much leſs than thoſe of the firſt.

But, before we leave them, be pleaſed to remark, Sir, that this filthy debauchery, which is the ſubject thereof, is a many-headed Monſter, and a ſpring which divides it ſelf into ſeveral rivolets. To ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the men of the world acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no other incontinence, than that of the Body, which is accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the union of Sexes. But the Goſpel whoſe morality is infinitely more holy than that of men, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es four others beſides that, which it likewiſe affirms to be very criminal, to wit, that of the heart, that of the eyes, that of the mouth, and that of the hand.</p>
            <p>The incontinence of the heart is nothing elſe but the Concupiſence of Women, and a violent deſire of being joyned with them, through the ſole principle of a ſenſual pleaſure.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108454:49"/>Naturally we find a ſatisfaction in the thoughts of a handſome Woman, and we revolve agreeably in our minds the remembrance of what we have ſeen aimable in them.

            <p>This infemous love ſo captivates all the ſences and all the faculties, that the principal end the Soul propoſes to it ſelf, is to ſatisfie the paſſion.

            <p>You will admire perhaps that I give to the eyes a particular forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108454:50"/>that nothing is more common in the world, than this ſort of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs. I dare even affirm, that the eyes corrupt the heart, and the one would be innocent, if the others were not faulty. In effect the eyes are the Gates or Windows of the Soul. It is by them that objects enter into it; and theſe objects exite therein the motions of Concupiſence; from whence comes this common Axiom, <hi>Objecta movent ſenſum.</hi> 'Tis for this <hi>Quintilian</hi> regards the eyes, as the path which leads Vice into the Soul. <hi>Vitijs noſtris in animo per oculos via eſt.</hi>

            <p>Alas there are but few now a days like <hi>Job,</hi> who made a contract with his eyes not to look upon a Virgin. One ſees every where laſcivious eyes. The Publick walks ſerve only to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their immodeſty. They reſpect not even the Altars of the Lord, and the Aſſemblies of his People. If a man diſcovers a Lady there of a well made, agreeable aſpect, he willingly prefers the pleaſure of obſerving her, to that of diſcharging the duties of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. There needs no more to freeze the hotteſt devotion. <hi>Homo ex humo ſine hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitate non eſt homo.</hi> Man is made out of the earth, nor is a man without hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
            <p>By the luſt of the mouth, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend thoſe filthy Words and Songs, ſo unbecoming and laſcivious, that hurt chſt ears, that excite the reddeſt modeſty, and whereof the uſe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is ſo frequent amongſt men. This is certainly a ſpecies of fornication, as well by the pleaſure
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108454:51"/>that is taken in uttering theſe obſceni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as becauſe they are the inkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of concupiſence, and contribute much to the corrupting of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. One may even be aſſured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of a miſtake, that thoſe who are pleafed with ſuch kind of diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, are already very much corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their hearts. In effect, the mouth ſpeaks only from the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the heart, as Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. One is the interpreter of the other. The mouth ſpeaks ill, becauſe the heart thinks ill. The effect pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues the nature of its cauſe: and ſuch as the principle is, ſuch alſo is the act. <hi>Ream linguam non facit, niſi mens rea.</hi> We may even affirm; that theſe laſcivious tongues are almoſt an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible proof of a licentious life; for as St. <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> ſays, <hi>Verbae ſint ſigna eorum,</hi> Words are the images or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of things. The words of men very often give us to underſtand what they are.</p>
            <p>There is very little appearance that a man will not act as he loves to talk, and that being immodeſt in his converſation he ſhould not be ſo in his conduct.</p>
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:108454:52"/>
            <p> If in the morality of our Saviour, one muſt give an account of uſeleſs words, which are neither good nor evil; Judge, Sir, what a reckoning thoſe will have, who make theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and hurtful words a ſubject of diverſion, and who have contracted ſo large a habit of them, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expreſs themſelves, whether in ſpeaking, or in writing, without na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming every thing by its name; As the <hi>Plautus</hi>'s, the <hi>Horaces</hi>'s, the <hi>Ovia</hi>'s of the time paſt, the <hi>Rebalai</hi>'s and the <hi>Montaign</hi>'s of our time. It muſt be confeſſed that nothing is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of a Gentleman, than this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of action. Modeſty is the thing of the world moſt agreeable to Man, but eſpecially eſſential to a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. It is a character that denotes him from all the reſt. What was more carefully and earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us by the Apoſtles, than a purity and ſanctity in all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation?</p>
            <p>In fine, what ſhall I ſay of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the hand with relation to this miſerable ſin of wantonneſs. O God, what abominations! what obſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities!
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108454:52"/>what unlawful uſes! what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous things, which one durſt not either think or relate, doth it not commit? This crime, which modeſty will not ſuffer to be named, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as it is, is ne'er the leſs enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. It was long ſince ſtruck with the curſe of Heaven in the perſon of <hi>Onan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.9.</note> Son of <hi>Judah,</hi> whereof the Scripture tells us.</p>
            <p>Is it a wonder after all this, that God ſhould have ſo much horror for this crime? Is it any ſurpriſe that he ſhould thunder againſt it ſuch dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful menaces? It is matter of conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that he ſhould join to it an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riditary curſe upon families? In a word, that he ſhould ſo often bring upon the people and upon private perſons ſuch terrible marks of his diſpleaſure? It muſt be granted that nothing is more frequent in Holy Scripture, than prohibitions to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this Sin, and the examples of its puniſhment. It is not in the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue alone, that God ſays, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery. He ſpeaks it in a thouſand other places of his
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:108454:53"/>word. The New Teſtament eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally recommends to us nothing elſe. The Sermons of our Saviour, and the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles are filled therewith. Their principal end is to diſpoſe us to a purity of body and mind: and they proteſt that nothing is more diſpleaſing to God, than the polluted Garment of the fleſh. It is not <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomarrha</hi> alone that has drawn down the fire of Heaven. Alas! a thouſand other Cities, and an infinite number of other ſinners have been conſumed in all Ages and all Nations upon account of this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Luſt. But admit there was nothing elſe except the puniſhments of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, and that hideous Lake of Fire and Brimſtone, to which in the Theology of Jeſus Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles it neceſſarily leads men, needs there any more to convince us, that nothing is more pernicious, and ought to be more ſoveraignly hated by us?</p>
            <p>Is it not ſtrange, perhaps you'll ſay, that God who knows Man ſo well, ſhould with ſo much exactneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit a thing, which is ſo natural to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:108454:53"/>him, and that he ſhould condemn him to the puniſhments of Hell for a Sin, which it is almoſt impoſſible for him not to commit in one of thoſe kinds you have treated of? doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, That the fleſh is not ſubject to the Law of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7.</note> neither can it be.</p>
            <p>I reply, Sir, that this great propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity it ſelf, which Man naturally has for this debauchery is one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal reaſons, that have oblig'd the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator to joyn ſo much puniſhment to it, and to thunder ſo many Curſes upon it. If inſpite of his prohibition and all his threatnings, Man is inſolent enough to abandon himſelf to it as much as he doth, judge to what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs he hath puſhed on the crime, and what he had been able to attempt without it.</p>

            <p>All theſe calamities are undoubtedly very great, but approach not the loſs of Salvation, which very often attends the ſin of Luſt. The Whoremong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſays the Scripture, ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. Their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in a lake of Sulpher. In effect,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108454:57"/>this of all ſins makes the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitents. There is not one that's more pleaſing to the fleſh. 'Tis found agreeable in every Age. The very Grey-beards are no leſs ſubject to it, than youngmen. If they have leſs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, they are oftentimes more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcent. The two Elders in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> who were ſo taken with her beauty, and ſeeing her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in her Garden burnt for love of her, are a very ſenſible example of it. If old-Age be impotent in reſpect of action, it is not ſo in reſpect of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. When old, we always wiſh to do what we did being young, and if we are not able yet we find a ſort of pleaſure in deſiring it, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining our ſelves with it, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid of himſelf. O God! That ever Man ſhould be ſo wretched as to endanger eternal and infinite joys for ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid, ſhort delights! That Men of ſuch contrivance and wiſdom in the civil and politick life, ſhould be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch a monſtrous indiſcretion!

            <p>In a word, Sir, if you are not yet perſuaded, that nothing is more infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, or more pernicious than Luſt, conſider the diſorders which it cauſes in the world and in Families, then queſtion it if you can. One muſt refer to this deteſtable Sin the greateſt part of general and particular, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and domeſtick quarrels. How often has it embroild States, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown Empires? How many Wars and diſputes has it occaſiond? How many Marriages has it diſturbed, and made unhappy? If a man conſiders, he ſhall find that it is the Origine of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the thorns of thoſe, who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ill. If Husbands lovd their Wives as tenderly as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſis</hi> did his <hi>Penelope:</hi> and if Wives were as faithful to their Husbands, as <hi>Penelope</hi> was to her <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liſſis,</hi> 'tis certain that we ſhould not ſee a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108454:58"/>hundreth part of thoſe diſgraces that we do. They are owing to the want of this common wiſdom of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, at leaſt generally ſpeaking. From this principle ariſe thoſe evil humours, and cruel jealouſies, which cauſe to them both ſuch ſmart vexations.</p>
            <p>But it is not only in this that Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence is fatal to the World. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in this reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> That it aims at nothing but its ruine in averting Men from Marriage; which is the true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of its preſervation. Would you know the difference between Marriage and Fornication? Marriage propoſes nothing to itſelf but the propagation of Mankind, whereas the other aims at its deſtruction. <hi>Adulter non prolem, ſed vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptatem quaerit.</hi> Marriage glories in the production of Children. Fornication is aſhamed of it, and tends only to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their generation. What hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, what infamies are practis'd for that end? 'Tis eaſie to conceive them. But it would be indecent to expreſs them. So that the world re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from this vice a prejudice proportioned to all thoſe great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which it draws from Marriage,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:108454:58"/>whereof I have diſcourſed in my firſt Part. Will you not confeſs after all this, that it is the greateſt of all crimes, and that <hi>Cicero</hi> could not have hit better, when he ſaid that all evils put together were not equal to this? <hi>Si unum in locoum collata ſint ommia mala, cum turpitudinis malo non erunt comparan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to what remains, I diſtinguiſh not between Fornication, Adultery, and keeping of Concubines. Yet I know one might obſerve difference: for all Concubine-keeping is a Fornication, but all Fornication and Adultery is not keeping of Concubines. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, all this is but one and the ſame ſpecies of Sin. It is one in it ſelf, and is only diverſiſived by the State of thoſe who commit it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But why do you ſo ſeverely prohibit,</hi> you'll ſay perhaps, <hi>a thing that</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>himſelf permitted to the</hi> Jews, <hi>and which was practiſed by the Patriarchs, and the ancient Kings of</hi> Iſrael? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>had many Wives, and various Concubines.</hi> Solomon <hi>had even to the number of a thouſand; and</hi> Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy, <hi>keeping of Concubines, and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108454:59"/>of Divorce have been of uſe, and are at this time amongſt divers People of the earth.</hi> This objection is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the matter I treat of: and it immediately ſeems ſo favourable to the inclinations of the fleſh, that it is no wonder it falls into the minds of all men: and that Fornicators make uſe of it to flatter themſelves in their irregularity. It is long ſince that theſe ſort of Perſons, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ancient Heriticks have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed thereby to authoriſe their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil conduct, and pernicious ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the ſubject of intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer firſt, that God from the beginning of the World eſtabliſhed Marriage between two Perſons only, <hi>Man</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſhall leave his Father and Mother,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The example of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs and Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> makes no conſequence againſt a Law ſo expreſs as that is, becauſe according to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Fathers of the Church, if they did not confine themſelves to it, it was through a very particular and myſterious permiſſion of God. Not to ſay that as good Men as they were, they were ſtill men; capable of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning like the reſt. <hi>David</hi> himſelf aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, that there is not one juſt perſon; and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays that the moſt perfect falls ſeven times a day.</p>

            <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that herein they were ſeduced by their temper; and that the force of cuſtom and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Idolatrous Nations, in the midſt of which they lived, contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much thereto. But at the ſame
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108454:60"/>time we ought to be perſuaded that God beſtowed on them the Grace of Repentance; and to admire the ways of his eternal Wiſdom, which has often times made uſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſins of its own Servants, to make us apprehend exceeding miſeries. Which made St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſay, that the very faults of the Patriarchs were advantagious to us. <hi>Inſtruunt Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archae non ſolum docentes, ſed etiam er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In effect, St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſcovers to the <hi>Gallatians</hi> a great myſtery in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubinary Union of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> and in the birth of <hi>Iſmael</hi> his Son. Are not we acquainted likewiſe that the very inceſtious Fornication of <hi>Judah</hi> with <hi>Thamer</hi> his Daughter in Law, has ſerved Providence to make thereof one of the Characters of the humiliation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh was derived from <hi>Pharez,</hi> one of thoſe Children that ſprung from this unlawful copulation. And it is in this conſideration that a holy Man has ventured to call even the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> happy, becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it we had been deprived of this
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108454:60"/>Great Redeemer, who makes all the glory of our Nature, and all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our Souls. <hi>O! felix culpa,</hi>

            <p>Moreover the faults of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Patriachs ought to advantage us by way of precaution. Beſides we live under a diſpenſation infinitely more than that of the Patriarchs and Jews. <hi>Moſes</hi> for the hardneſs of their hearts allowed them divers things, that Jeſus Chriſt has prohibited us. But do not we know that the Church was in its Infancy under the Law, and that it is in its Manhood under the Goſpel? It would be ſhameful for us to be no wiſer than they, and to practice in this perfect age of grace, where we are arrived, the ſame acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they practiſed under the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect age of the Law. <hi>If your Juſtice doth not exceed that of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi>

            <p>The Jews of the firſt Chriſtian Penticoſt, after having been convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of infidelity and felony againſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108454:61"/>Chriſt by a Sermon of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> cried out in the motions of their ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do? If the things which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to you concerning the ſin of Incontinence have an influance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you and you ask me juſt in the ſame manner, what you muſt do to avoid it, I anſwer to you in the firſt place what St. <hi>Peter</hi> replied to the Jews, Repent. There is no method more ſecure than that, in order to put of entirely the bondage of the paſſions; or to ſay better, it is the only one whoſe ſucceſs is infallible to that end. When a man is truly converted, he has a holy diſlike of himſelf. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts his precedent converſation. He has a horrour for his crime. He finds no further pleaſure, but in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his God. He has a diſguſt for all the vain delights of the fleſh. <hi>David, Magdelain,</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> are great and admirable examples hereof. I reply to you in the ſecond place, Marry. In effect, although there is no condition happy enough to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly exempt from all the blots of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence, and that a thouſand mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108454:62"/>perſons fail not to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves faulty, yet it muſt be granted that Marriage is that of all conditions of Man, wherein he may beſt be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. 'Tis what St. <hi>Paul</hi> inſtructs us in that exhortation, which he makes to all men: To avoid Fornication, ſays he, let every man have his own Wife, and every Woman her own Husband.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108454:63"/>marry without any further enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Neverthelſs there are divers. o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her Motives which may diſpoſe them to it: and they appear to me conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable enough to make a particular part of this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>To begin where I finiſh'd the other, you ought to obſerve that Marriage is an eſſential remedy to Incontinence. Whatſoever you do to ſubdue your fleſh, and to allay the fire of its luſt, you will not eaſily accompliſh it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Marriage. Retirements, Faſtings, Diſciplines, Macerations, may leſſen part of the forces of this formidable enemy, but not abſolutely overcome him. Without a particular favour of Heaven, he will always triumph over your power; and in ſpite of all the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of your piety, you'll find it hard enough to avoid falling into one of the Fornications I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of. Nothing but Marriage can naturally cure you. That's the true Antidote againſt this mortal Poyſon. I repeat it once more: To avoid Fornication, let every Man have his Wife, and every Woman her Husband. Ought any one to quſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108454:63"/>after this the efficacy of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, to deliver us from this perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious malady? ſhould we not believe an Apoſtle, who brought all he has ſaid to us from the third Heaven, and who has given us nothing but what he received from the Lord himſelf? who could judge better than he, of our neceſſities? I am ſurpriſed that after ſo expreſs an Order to Marry, and ſo authentick a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the neceſſity of Marriage in reference to Salvation, there ſhould be a ſingle man in the world, that can have it in contempt.</p>
            <p>This is ſo much the more ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, as this Order is as ancient as the World. It is not from St. <hi>Paul.</hi> It is from God himſelf. As ſoon as he had formed Man, he gave him a Wife. He married him. And he commanded all his deſcendents to marry. Jeſus Chriſt has renewed the precept under the Goſpel. I don't pretend, Sir, that this command is abſolute and obligatory for all men, as ſome have been of opinion. A man doth not abſolutely diſobey God in remaining a Batchelour, provided
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108454:64"/>that he lives piouſly in that ſtate. How many perſons are there, who are improper for Marriage? But I affirm that herein God was pleaſed to let us know, that it is a condition very agreeable to him, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly neceſſary to fulfill all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of humanity, and to accompliſh all the ends of our Creation. The Apoſtle diſcovers in it another ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for Man, that is yet more important: To wit, as I have ſaid, that it may much contribute to make him live piouſly in cauſing him to avoid Incontinence. Inſomuch that he anſwers at the ſame time, both the end of Nature, which is to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply men: and the end of Grace, which is to ſanctifie them.</p>

            <p> I cannot forbear, Sir, at preſent to improve the uſefulneſs, to ſay no worſe, of the Celebacy of Lay-men. If it be a virtue, certainly 'tis none of the moſt conſiderable. It is even of the nature of thoſe, which very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten lead the way to vice. What ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage doth it bring to them, unleſs it be to expoſe them to great temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations? unleſs it be to deprive them of a very commodious aſſiſtant, ſuch as a Wife is? unleſs it be to renounce the ſweeteſt of Societies? And this, for I know not what difficulties they frame to themſelves; whereof one part is purely imaginary, another is tyed to all the conditions of life, and the reſt is nothing in compariſon of the real pleaſures of Marriage. What advantages likewiſe return from thence to the Republick? People are oftener ſcandaliſed than improved thereby, and very often are ſeen examples of them, which more deſerve our hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, than our imitation.

            <p> The moſt favourable judgment that one can make of the wiſeſt Celeba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is, that it is a virtue which doth neither good nor evil. Now for this reaſon that it is without action, one may ſay that it is a kind of vice: for according to <hi>Cicero, Virtutis laus omnis in actione conſiſt it.</hi> From whence comes this of <hi>Silius</hi> the <hi>Italian.</hi>

            <p>If we beleive the Naturaliſts, this deſire extends to inſenſible things. They tell us of divers Plants that can neither encreaſe nor fructifie without company, as the Palm amongſt others. And can Man after this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violating in ſome meaſure the rights of Nature, deſpiſe his union with Woman, that is to ſay, what ſhe has of moſt compleat and charming? Tis true, as the Ancients ſay, that Man is of a nature abſolutely He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical, that can innocently excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from her. But how ridiculous and unjuſt is he, add they, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Marriage, the firſt and pureſt of Societies?</p>
            <p>But, Sir, if you would know the real motives of Marriage, you are only to conſider Man with relation to the four bodies, whereof he is compoſed. I ſhall call the firſt, The Body Natural. The ſecond, The Body Politick. The third, The Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Domeſtick. And the fourth, The
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:108454:67"/>Body Eccleſiaſtick. Mankind, State, Family, and Church are theſe four Bodies. With relation to mankind, he is Man. To the State he is Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen. To the Family he is Son. And to the Church, he is Faithful. Theſe four qualities put him equally under the obligigation of Marriage. As Man he ought to labour for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of mankind. As Citizen, for the preſervation of the Common-wealth. As Son he ows Succeſſors to his Family; and as Faithful, he owes Elect ones to the Church. Marriage is abſolutely neceſſary to fulfill all theſe duties, and to diſcharge all theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements. They ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd to you more at length.</p>
            <p>To begin with the firſt point; It is certain that every Animal is oblig'd to intereſt himſelf in the conſervation of his Species, but particularly Man, who is king of all. Tis for him that all the reſt were made: and without him the world would be but a frightfull So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude. For this reaſon God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to increaſe and multiply immediately after his Creation. And for the ſame reaſon he inſpir'd him
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108454:68"/>with the deſire of it, and gave him that eager inclination of Cooperating with another Sex, wherewith all men, as I have ſaid, are naturally tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It muſt be granted that there is nothing in nature either ſo violent, or ſo neceſſary. Without this love, wheres that man that would converſe with woman? wheres the woman, that would endure man? But to the end that no abuſe might be made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, God has aſſigned it bounds, he has fixed it between two perſons, he has confined it to the ſacred laws of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Be it as it will, if it is mans duty to increaſe his Species, it is no leſs his duty to marry ſince one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably be done without the other.</p>
            <p>Man may be conſidered in a double ſence, <hi>vel Phyſice, vel Theologice.</hi> In the Theological proſpect nothing is more diſpiſable, it's true, 'tis a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted Subject. It is a ſinful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is an object of Horror to Heaven and Earth. It is a compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of crimes and miſeries. Man, ſays the Prophet, in this reſpect, is nothing but Vanity. If one ſhould
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108454:68"/>weigh him with nothing he would be found even lighter. They are all, ſays he elſewhere, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and become abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable by their works.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1.</note> There is not one doth good. But in the Phyſical and Natural ſence, what is more admirable than Man? <hi>O God,</hi> ſaid the ſame <hi>David, What is Man that thou ſhouldſt remember him; and the Son of Man that thou ſhouldſt be ſo careful of him. Thou haſt made him but a little leſs than the Angels. Thou haſt crowned him with glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Thou haſt given him the Empire of all things here below.</hi> In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Philoſopher regards him as the end of all Creatures. <hi>Nos ſumus quodam modo ſinis omnium.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ariſt.</note> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> likewiſe inſtructs us that all things are compriſed in him. <hi>In homine eſt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis creatura;</hi> He conſiders him as the miracle of Nature. <hi>Homo magnum eſt miraculum.</hi> And our eloquent <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> will have him to be of more worth than all other creatures together. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo caeteris animalibus longe praeſtat.</hi> I add that this ſame Theology, which leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108454:69"/>him ſo much, when it conſiders him in the irregularities of Nature, exalts him to the higheſt Heaven; to the ſociety of Angels; to the glory of Eternity, when it conſiders him in thoſe Priviledges which Grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers upon him. Man then is without diſpute what there is moſt precious and recommendable in the world. And yet it is the fruit of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. It is from thence it derives its Original. What greater motive can one preſent him with in order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to it.</p>
            <p>Every one naturally covets to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalize himſelf in the imployment he profeſſeth; and to perform thoſe things which may procure him the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Poſterity. Twas this am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition that gave us the Speeches of a <hi>Demoſthenes;</hi> the Orations of a <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> and ſo many other maſter-pieces of the mind, which we read with ſo much pleaſure. What elſe has made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal the <hi>Apelles,</hi> the <hi>Michael-Angeli,</hi> the <hi>Titians,</hi> and all thoſe other famous Artiſts of Antiquity, whoſe works the curious ſtill buy and value more than Gold. And, what! if man is ſo
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:108454:69"/>much affected at the glory of making, either a good book, or an excellent Picture, or a curious Statue, is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he ſhould be inſenſible of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of compoſing Men? that is to ſay, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſelves; that is to ſay, moſt lively I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas of the Divinity; ſuch noble frames, that all the Gold of the <hi>Indies</hi> can never purchaſe, and are of more account than the world it ſelf? What can be more admirably noble than this ambition? If man in particular is of ſo great price, of what eſteem ſhould all in general be? And if the deſire of giving ſome individuals to Human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ought to diſpoſe us for Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, how much more the preſervation of his whole body, which abſolutely depends thereon? The ſingle uſe of reaſon in Beaſts (if one may ſay they have reaſon) is to ſecure their lives from dangers; but its great uſe in men is to multiply theirs, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their kinds. <hi>

            <p>My reply to this falſe reaſoning is this, that one can never lawfully uſe Women out of Marriage under any pretence whatſoever.

In its pure maxims all other ways of peopling the world are unlawful and prohibited. 'Tis what ſhe has even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the hearts of all honeſt men. Thoſe States, that acted only by their Principles, and to whom the orders of God were unknown, have not ceaſed to recommend Marriage as the moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of Societies: and to forbid Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence as the ſhame of humanity. I have already made it appear, there needs no more upon this head.</p>
            <pb n="100" facs="tcp:108454:71"/>
            <p> But, Sir, if we would be intirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ication, Polygamy, and Concubine-keeping are no lawful ways of multiplying men, and that nothing more diſpleaſes Heaven, conſider the Countries where theſe kinds of Liberties are permitted. Do you imagine that the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and the <hi>Pagans,</hi> who live in all theſe diſorders, encreaſe their Species more than the Chriſtians, who abhor them? It is certain that they are even leſs fertile. Did you never make reflection upon the Sheep and the Wolves? The firſt produce but once a year, and only one Lamb at each time. Notwithſtanding altho' an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them is eaten every day, the earth is covered with them. The laſt on the other ſide generate many times a year, and bring forth no leſs than ſix or ſeven little ones. Beſides being impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the nouriſhment of men, their number is not leſſened for this uſe. And yet we know that there are but few of them ſeen in compariſon of Sheep. Who makes a doubt that there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Providence therein? It is exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame with all thoſe prohibited U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, whereof I have treated, and with lawful Marriage. Who would not ſay
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108454:71"/>that <hi>Turkey, Perſia, Japan,</hi> and all thoſe other Countrys where it is permitted to have ſeveral Wives, and various Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, muſt be infinitely populous? and yet they are leſs numerous than Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. Altho' the Bed of Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts but of two perſons, it doth not ceaſe to be much more fertile, than that of all theſe Infidels, as manifold as it is. There is no appearance of reaſon in refering this to the ſingle climate and particular conſtitution of Men. There is without diſpute ſomewhat of myſtery therein. God and nature were pleaſed to let us know by the ſame, that the union of one man with one ſingle woman is the real method one muſt purſue for the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of mankind Do we not know likewiſe that almoſt all thoſe Whores and debanch'd Women, who are the ſcandal of their Sex, are barren, and that the greateſt part of them need not make uſe of a thouſand ſorts of criminal ways to become ſo, as they do every day? It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains then to conclude that nothing but Marriage can really and lawfully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh this firſt end of Nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of indiſpenſible obligation to Men.</p>
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:108454:72"/>
            <p> The quality of Citizens of the world, and members of the State, is a reaſon of no leſs force to diſpoſe them to it. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſays that Man is an Animal natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally politick. This is very true. Scarce were Men upon the Earth but they thought how to erect themſelves into a Body, into a Common-wealth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Kingdom. The moſt barbarous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have voluntarily ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves either to a Monarchy, or to an Ariſtocracy, or elſe to a Democracy. Monarchy without doubt is the beſt of the three, becauſe it comes neareſt to the Divinity. But they are all lawful and permitted of God; add, Sir, that they are all likewiſe very neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more fatal to Society than Anarchy. Where there is no Superior all the world aims at being ſo. Men live in an eternal confuſion. The Laws are diſpoſſeſſed of their Authority.

In a word, what can one imagine to be of more importance for him, then the holy State of Marriage, which alone furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es him with Subjects and Soveraigns for thoſe many Empires of the world, which retain men in the duty of concord, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, and Juſtice?</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108454:73"/>certain then, that man is under a double obligation to labour, both for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogation of mankind and the ſubſiſtence of that ſtate wherein he is engaged. If Marriage is neceſſary for the one, it is no leſs for the other. The beſt way of ſerving his Prince and Country doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is to furniſh him with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber both of brave Subjects and wiſe Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens, ſit for thoſe uſes which may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage the Publick.</p>
            <p>This conſideration has been a motive to ſeveral People of the World not only to ſpeak of Marriage with praiſe, but alſo to reward its fertillity with magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence. The <hi>Romans</hi> appointed publick honours to thoſe women, who had brought into the world ſeven or eight Children; and with a Penſion that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Glory of their Empire, they gave a place in the Capitol to their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. In effect, Marriage as I have ſaid, is the ſafety of the Republick; ſince it is the only Nurſery from whence proceeds all its Captains, all its Magiſtrates, all its Hand craf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>smen, and in a word all thoſe different ſorts of Subjects, whoſe various imployments and perpetual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination one to the other make up the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of States, and of the whole World. As much then as Man is concerned in his own preſervation, and that of his Country, ſo much is he obliged to Marry.</p>
            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:108454:73"/>
            <p> If this general Intereſt ought to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Man for Marriage, there is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular one that obliges him to it much more: It is the Intereſt of his Family. What would become of that without Marriage? one Generation would ſee it begin and end. The quality of Father, which is in life moſt worthy of our am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, would appertain but to few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. What ought we to eſteem dearer than our Blood? and what nobler Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie can we be inflamed with than to leave behind us a numerous Poſterity? Why, do you imagine, has Nature given Men an inclination to labour, to occaſion them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a thouſand Cares, and a thouſand Difficulties to heap up Riches, a hundred times more than they ought for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? I make no doubt but it is becauſe ſhe has likewiſe given them an Inclination to multiply, and to produce Children, to whom they leave the fruits of their watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and induſtry. One may affirm that this is the deſign of all honeſt Men, even thoſe Batchelors that collect great Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, very often do it for the Advancement of their Nephews, and always from a Proſpect of ſupporting their Families.</p>
            <pb n="142" facs="tcp:108454:74"/>
            <p> There is nothing perhaps more reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable than this Duty: If we believe St. <hi>Paul, He is worſe than an Infidel who is unmindful of his Family.</hi> Do not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Sir,</hi> that he has regard only to thoſe who neglect the Subſiſtence and Education of their Children: He ſpeaks likewiſe of thoſe, who being uncapable of preſerving Continence, neglect the means of having any; and who rather than Marry, chooſe to let their Race be extinguiſhed, and to efface their Names from the Memory of Men. <hi>Worſe than an Infidel;</hi> O good God! what can be worſe than an Infidel in the World, that is to ſay, than a <hi>Turk</hi> or a <hi>Pagan?</hi> It muſt be granted, that the Apoſtle could never more expreſly recommend Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, than by expreſſing himſelf in that manner. But it muſt be likewiſe agreed, that nothing ought to be more preſſing to determine Men for it: For in a word, what has been long ſince aſſerted, is very true;

               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:108454:74"/>Children are the only ſupport of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, without them they muſt of Neceſſity fall, they muſt be reduced to nothing.</p>
            <p>What was more inſupportable to the <hi>Jews,</hi> than the Unfruitfulneſs of their Wives, or their own: They lookt upon it as a ſort of Curſe, and they valued not all the other Advantages of Life, while they were deprived of the Bleſſing of Children. Conſider, in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the Complaints of a <hi>Sarah</hi> and a <hi>Rachel</hi> upon this Occaſion. I know very well that the ſending of the Meſſias, who had been promis'd to our firſt Parents, was to theſe Perſons a particular Motive to deſire Children, every one hoping to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in his Family that invaluable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Heaven. But I am ſenſible at the ſame time that many of them ſigh'd after Succeſſors from the ſingle Proſpect of contributing ſomewhat to the Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their Nation and Family, and that they only requeſted Children becauſe they lookt upon them as the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Poſſeſſion of the World, as indeed they are.

            <p> The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſo violently fond of having Children, that they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended there could be no ſeverer Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them than to paſs away their Lives either in Barrenneſs or Celibacy. <hi>God has taken away my Reproach,</hi> ſaid <hi>Rachel,</hi> when ſhe was delivered of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> her firſt-born. The Daughter of <hi>Jephtah</hi> likewiſe declares to us the ſame thing;<note place="margin">Judges 11.</note> this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Father having for the accompliſhment of his raſh vow condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her to the civil death of a perpetual Retreat, according to the opinions of the beſt Authors; She requeſted of him a Damoſel or two in order to go and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her Virginity for two Months. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt a thouſand things ſhe had to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret in leaving the world, ſhe eſteems nothing more worthy of her tears, than to have been unmarried and incapable of marrying. I am perſwaded that the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelors had the ſame deſire for Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age as the Maidens had, and that both Sexes were under an equal paſſion for this condition of life. We may inferr it from the prodigious multiplication of the family of <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi> When it
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:108454:75"/>went down there, it was compoſed but of ſeventy perſons in all, and when they departed from thence four hundred and thirty years after, they were ſix hundred thouſand Men, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting Women and Children,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.37.</note> who in all appearance amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to twice or thrice the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as it is eaſy to imagine. Prodigious and ſcarce to be believed but in ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing what is true! and that no People ever ſo much loved, or practifed Marriage, as this ancient People, and that they confin'd themſelves under it's pleaſing chains, almoſt as ſoon as they diſtinguiſh'd reaſon. This People, Sir, was the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; whom he tenderly loved; a People, whom he lookt upon as his moſt valuable Treaſure. A People, for whom he multiplied every day the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his Providence and Wiſdom. In a word, a People who ought by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to ſerve for an Example to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther People upon the Subject of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which was in the midſt of them, and ſo much recommended and bleſt of God.</p>

            <p> What, do you ſuppoſe, <hi>David</hi> calls the greateſt of the bleſſings of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth? It is neither Riches, nor Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, nor even a Crown. He paſſes beyond all this without haeſitation. The happineſs which he engages to him that fears God, is to have a fruitful Bed and a numerous Poſterity. Would you know, Sir, thoſe two men, of all thoſe whom the Scripture ſpeaks of, that I eſteem to have been the moſt happy of the world? Do not imagine that it is either a <hi>David,</hi> or a <hi>Solomon,</hi> or an <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> They are <hi>Ibzan</hi> and <hi>Abdon.</hi> If you ask me the reaſon,<note place="margin">Judges. 12.9.14.</note> you may read it in the Book of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are they. There you will find con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt, that he had thirty Sons and thirty Daughters. And of the ſecond, that he had forty Sons and thirty Grand-Children, whom he ſaw all together on horſe-back. What can be a greater hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to a Father? What can be more obſervable in the life of a man? It is likewiſe true, that the ſacred Author in ſpeaking to us of thoſe two famous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, contents himſelf to report this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:108454:76"/>circumſtance of them; which in my opinion goes beyond all the great deeds of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may apprehend it as you pleaſe, but to me it ſeems that ſuch a geniture contains ſomewhat very noble in it, and that one cannot be obſerved in the Hiſtory of Men through a finer place. It muſt be granted that theſe Men well underſtood the Art of immortalizing their Families. What, Sir, will not ſo great an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple encourage you to look after the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of yours? would you ſuffer it to periſh with your Name for want of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying? will you always entertain a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance for Marriage? will you never diveſt your ſelf of thoſe falſe Ideas, you have conceiv'd thereof? will you always be ingenious to frame to your ſelf, in order to remove your ſelf from it, ſuch puniſhments as do not exiſt, which I ſhall make appear in the ſequel? and will you never be convinced of thoſe real delights which I have ſhewn to be in that ſtate, and which ought to attract the whole world? It is the only advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that is wanting to your happineſs. But aſſure your ſelf, that without this all
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:108454:77"/>the reſt is of no value. As well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as you are with the goods of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and Morals, can you fail to pleaſe your ſelf in <hi>Hymen,</hi> and to partake of pleaſures a thouſand times more affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than thoſe which can be found in the happieſt Celibacy? How much ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ſhall you give to thoſe illuſtrious perſons, to whom you owe all things with your being? what glory ſhall you not obtain by adding to their comfort what they deſire with the utmoſt zeal? can you decently refuſe them this mark of your acknowledgment? muſt they go down to the grave without ſeeing a young Sprig ſhoot forth from you, that may aſſure them their Name and Blood will not periſh with you? will you give them cauſe to make this ſad complaint of you?</p>

               <note place="margin">Muſon apud Stobaeum, <hi>Serm.</hi> 186.</note>

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:108454:78"/>Common-wealths, and all humane Kind would be abſolutely annihilated, and that Marriage is the ſole lawful cauſe of theſe Generations, according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark of this learned man, judge of the obligation you are under to marry. The heavenly voice ſeems to call you to it. Reſiſt no longer its Vocation. But to the end that you may know all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements you are under to pay obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it, make ſome reflections, if you pleaſe, upon the quality of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which you have taken into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of the Church.</p>
            <p>This, Sir, is the greateſt motive, which ought to determine you for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. It even recollects in it ſelf all the reſt. What do you take the Church to be? It is according to St. <hi>Paul, the City of the living God,</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem <hi>from on high,</hi>

            <pb n="151" facs="tcp:108454:78"/>
            <p> The divine Family, whereof God is the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the eldeſt Son, and the Elect the younger ones, if one may be allowed to ſpeak ſo. Tell me, I beſeech you, if in all theſe regards, there is any thing more precious in the world, than the Church? Tell me like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if there is any thing, to whoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence men are more obliged to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute? What are all our Intereſts in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that? If you ask me the true reaſon, that ought to make us deſire the propagation of Mankind, the duration of States, and the Conſervation of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: It is nothing elſe but the Subſiſtence of the Church, which is infinitely more excellent than the World, and all its So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties. This ought to be the chiefeſt end of all our Vows, and all our Cares.</p>
            <p>How ought a Chriſtian, do you think, to endeavour the advancement of this Myſtical Empire of Jeſus Chriſt, the exaltation of his Reign; the Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of his Church? He may, Sir, acquit himſelf of this Duty in a double manner; both by Paſſion and by Action: Firſt, he muſt ſuffer, he muſt mortify
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:108454:79"/>himſelf. In the Second place, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that he labour, and put himſelf in action for her. Now of all the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that may contribute to this end, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is without doubt the principal: Since it is the natural and material cauſe of the faithful, without which all moral cauſes would be abſolutely uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> built his Tabernacle, the Men and Women contributed volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and with great Zeal, all that was neceſſary for its conſtruction. What ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal would it be for Chriſtians not to do for the Truth, what the <hi>Jews</hi> did for the Figure? Thoſe people diſpoſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with pleaſure of the moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things they had, in order to enrich that ancient Tent of the Deſart. What ſhould not we perform then for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Divine Tabernacle, which God has planted, and not Man? But Sir, the queſtion here is neither of Gold, nor Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, precious Stones. or fine Linnen, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or Scarlet. The Tabernacle of the Church is not compoſed of dead and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible things. Brutal and Inanimate Stones enter not into its conſtruction. There muſt be living ones for that end.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:108454:79"/>There muſt be faithful Men. There muſt be reaſonable creatures. There muſt be Chriſtians ſanctified by the aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the blood of Chriſt.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1, 2.16.</note> How glorious is it for a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother to contribute a great number of theſe living Stones for the Edification and Conſervation of the Church? Marriage is the only quarry, from whence they muſt be had. God allows of no other. Indeed they are not in a condition proper to build this holy ſtructure. <hi>My Mother conceived me in ſin, and brought me forth in iniquity,</hi> ſays <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> If we refer our ſelves even to the Satyrick Poet, he will likewiſe inſtruct us in what the Scripture every where tells us, <hi>that all Men are born with Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Nam vitijs nemo ſine naſcitur.<note place="margin">Horat. Serm. L. 1. Sat. 3.</note>
            </q>
            <p>But here Grace is added to Nature. Marriage makes Men: And of theſe men God makes his Elect. Inſomuch that it is ever true to ſay in a certain ſenſe, that Marriage makes the Elect, which are members of the Church; ſince it is the Organon of Nature to bring them into the world, and that Grace which rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:108454:80"/>them, acts upon them only as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on works of this very Nature. In this proſpect it is ſcarce poſſible to expreſs the excellency of Marriage, and what ſtrong engagements men are under to marry.</p>
            <p>Philoſophers ſay, that a Being may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it ſelf two ways, by Subſtraction, and by privation of means; either in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things contrary to its Subſiſtence, or in omitting thoſe things which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to it. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> deſtroyed the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the firſt manner: And thoſe who live unmarried now a days, deſtroy the Chriſtian Church in the ſecond. That barbarous King by cauſing all the Male Children of the <hi>Jews</hi> to be thrown into the <hi>Nile,</hi> rendred their propagation fruitleſs; and thoſe who remain in the ſtate of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle men, as far as they can, make it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. So that the Church is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to them for its ſubſiſtence. This Doctrine is even conformable to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Scripture, which ſays, that he who doth not prevent a mans death by furniſhing him with means to live, kills him. If this Theology be true, as we muſt not queſtion it, I can hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:108454:80"/>how all thoſe obſtinate and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Batchelors ſhould not be amazed thereat. What greater misfortune could arrive to them, than not only to have performed nothing for the Glory and Advantage of this undefiled Spoufe of our Saviour, which coſt him his life; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to have laboured for its deſtruction by not doing what is capable to preſerve it? Where is the State, where is the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where is the Society, more worthy to ſubſiſt than the Church? All the reſt is ſupported only for her ſake. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumna eſt Orbis Eccleſia,</hi> The World, this unhappy World, which ſo outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly perſecutes her, would be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without this daughter of Heaven. It is preſerved only to give place to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Elect. So ſoon as they are all in the Eſſence of things, adieu to the world. Heavens! What afflictions ſhould not thoſe old Batchelors undergo for not having contributed to its conformation?</p>
            <p>But Sir, one of thoſe things which ought, methinks, to be moſt prevailing with you for Marriage, is, that you will infallibly marry at one time or other. Sooner or later you will be inclined to it.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:108454:81"/>It is with Marriage, as with new faſhions. At firſt they appear inſupportable? But by little and little the eyes are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to them, and at length one ſubmits to them with others. How many men likewiſe do we obſerve, who after having long declamed againſt Marriage, fail not to confine themſelves under its laws? Are you ignorant that thoſe who ſpeak of it, as of a folly, ſay that it muſt be done once in a mans life? That Poet ſo know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Art of Love, whom I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cited ſo often, tells us with a grace that <hi>Venus</hi> never loſes her rights, and that all men are tributary to her.</p>

If Marriage is a ſort of folly, 'tis certainly a double one in that decrepit age, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man is good for nothing but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the diſmal Waſt of years; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by the weakneſs of Nature, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walk without the ſupport of a Stick; wherein a defenceleſs impotence confines him to the Empire of a young wife;

            <p>Who makes a doubt, that marriage in this caſe is not a real puniſhment? If it be true then, that you are deſtin'd for Marriage: If your Inclination muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you to it one day: If you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to avoid its yoak, as a thouſand Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and a thouſand Reaſons ſeem to perſwade: Is it not for your intereſt, Sir, as well as Prudence, to defer the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it no longer? why ſhould you not do that to day, which you neceſſarily muſt to morrow? why ſhould you drive off to the end of you life, a thing, which, that I may ſo ſpeak, ought to be fulfilled in the beginning?</p>
            <p>I could make this appear to you, Sir, in a very convincing manner, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the great advantages, that a happy Marriage brings to man; but as it is a Subject which I have enlarged upon in my firſt part, I will not make this of a longer extent. The ſingle reflection
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:108454:82"/>that I ſhall add, is, that it has always been of univerſal belief, that a good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Wife is the rareſt of all treaſures, and the ſweeteſt of poſſeſſions.</p>

            <p>To make an end of convincing you, ſhall I alledge yet, that the life of the wiſeſt Batchelor comes much nearer to Libertiniſm, than that ſtrict Wiſdom which is the eſſential character of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, and which has rendred the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>'s, and the <hi>Cato</hi>'s ſo famous in the <hi>Greck</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories?

               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:108454:83"/>It is certain that Marriage is of extream ſervice to retain a man in his Duty, and that it makes him avoid a thouſand oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to remove himſelf from it, which are very ordinary with Batchelors. As I have ſaid, we naturally love the Society of Women. So that if a man has not one of his own, he without difficulty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades himſelf to go and ſeek out others abroad. He ſees them, he courts them, he endeavours to get himſelf beloved by them, and oftentimes he ſucceeds but with too much eaſineſs. The handſomer they are, the greater is the danger for both. Our Eccleſiaſtical Author ſays, that many have been ſeduced by the Beauty of the wife. From whence come all thoſe Domeſtick Diſorders which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the condition of ſo many Husbands and Fathers unhappy; and which is owing to the wantonneſs of theſe wicked Batchelors, who by frequent Viſits and criminal inventions, have found out a means to corrupt the vertue of their Wives and Daughters?</p>

               <hi>Fourth Part.</hi> Where the Objections which are made againſt Marriage, and the falſe Reaſons which are ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to live Unmarried, are anſwered.</head>
            <p>I Enter, Sir, into the greateſt and moſt formidable battel that was ever given. To make no doubt hereof, you are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conſider the Subject, the Parties, and the Arms. Marriage is the Subject. The buſineſs is to know whether it be uſeful and advantagious for Man, and conducive to his Happineſs. A Queſtion infinitely important, ſince it extends to the deciſion of the Fate of all Mankind. The Parties I have to engage with, are well near all men. There are but few on my ſide, the greateſt part are combin'd againſt this holy Society, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:108454:85"/>ſo ſtrong an averſion againſt it, that they cannot bear to hear it commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor forbear to ſay all that's ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. Never was Combat more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal. My adverſaries are a thouſand to one. <hi>Non unius urbis, ſed univerſi orbis iniquam ſententiam ſuſtinet,</hi> ſays <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</hi> It is not only in one place, in one City, in one Kingdom, that Marriage is exclaim'd againſt, it is throughout all the Univerſe. As to the Arms of thoſe, with whom I have to deal, they are compoſed of leſs Reaſon than Paſſion; and ſavour more of Invective than of Juſtice. But yet they are ſo much the more dangerous, as they are favoured both by the temper of men, and the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of things. When a man reflects upon the ſweetneſs of Liberty, the ſad perplexities of Marriage, and all thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil managements which afflict Society, who would not ſay that all our Detracters ought to depend on victory in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute I undertake againſt them?</p>
            <p>But Sir, if <hi>Caeſar</hi> diſcourages me, St. <hi>Bernard</hi> on the other ſide, enlivens me. When the occaſion of the battel is juſt, ſays he, one cannot fail of ſucceeding in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:108454:85"/>it with advantage, <hi>Si bona fuerit cauſae pugnantis, belli excituus malus eſſe non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terit.</hi> Was there ever a cauſe juſter than that which I defend? It is for the intereſt of all Men, all Families, and all Nations. It is likewiſe for a thing of great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, whereon depends their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and without which it is impoſſible for them to ſubſiſt. In a word, it is not for a Subject contrary to Law, or Reaſon. It is for a Subject approved of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways recommended by wiſe Men, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by true Reaſon, agreeable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, and conformable to all ſort of right and equity. If a man may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to himſelf the protection of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in any attempt, ſurely he may in this.</p>
            <p>To reply in order to thoſe objections which are made againſt thoſe propoſitions I have eſtabliſh'd, one muſt immediately diſtinguiſh them into theſe three heads, to which in my eſteem they may eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Firſt, they object againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and ill Temper of Wives, whereof they make a moſt ſevere cenſure. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ſay of Marriage, that it is of it ſelf unworthy of Man, and that nothing leſs
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:108454:86"/>agrees with the perfection of his Being. And in the third place, they ſpeak of its Conſequences and Obligations, as of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable burden. I hope to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that in all theſe reſpects the cauſe of my Adverſaries is moſt deplorable, and that there is not only injuſtice, but even madneſs in the deſence of it.</p>
            <p>It is then by the conſideration of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that men begin to be diſguſted at Marriage. What diſobliging things do they not aſſert of them? with what Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, and Aſperſions do they tear their reputation, and their vertue? If one ſhould believe them, there would not be a Vice in Morality, but ought to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them: Nor a Misfortune in the world, whereof they are not the occaſion.</p>
            <p>Inconſtancy, ſay they, is one of the principal characters of a woman.</p>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:108454:86"/>thing which intervenes in her mind, makes her forget her promiſe; and violate her Faith. When you think your ſelf to be moſt in her favour, you are moſt in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. After having ſigh'd many years for the conqueſt of her heart, one ſingle moment apprehends its loſs. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſad examples have we ſeen of this inconſtant humour of the Sex?

            <p> The wife, ſay they, is only fit to make the husband miſerable. She is eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repugnant to his opinions. If a man propoſes Peace, it muſt be under the condition of ſurrendring his arms. She always inſiſts upon her own terms.

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:108454:87"/>know, and what they know not. In a word, ſay they, there are no ſorts of miſeries and vexations, but woman is capable of occaſioning to man, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there are no crimes but ſhe is able to commit.</p>

            <p>I ask pardon of the Ladies for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heap'd together ſo many outrages againſt them, and all thoſe invectives wherewith they are defamed. It was not without extream violence to my ſelf. As much as I love to ſpeak well of them,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:108454:88"/>ſo much pain is it to me to ſuffer them to be calumniated; but let them not be concerned at my Liberty, I hope it will be advantagious to them. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign I have to protect their perſecuted innocence, engaged me to it in an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable manner. 'Twas neceſſary to know whereof they were accuſed, in order to juſtify them. Behold then the principal heads of this great proceſs which the diſaffected of all Ages have entred againſt them. Let us ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are well grounded therein; or rather let us obſerve (for who ſees it not?) that they maintain therein the worſt cauſe in the world; and that there is not a ſingle perſon of them, but in the tribunal of an impartial juſtice ought to be condemn'd, to make reparation of honour to a Sex whoſe vertue every one ought to venerate, and not to aſſault its reputation?</p>
            <p>A man may immediately juſtify the Women by way of recrimination. If they deſerve to have defects imputed to them, are the Men exempt from them? if they have evil Qualities, are the men poſſeſſed of none but good ones? it will
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:108454:88"/>but ill become me, 'tis true, to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the party of my own Sex. I know that in the order of nature, it has conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable prerogatives over the other, and that it is of a much more excellent kind. <hi>Maſculinum neutraliter dignius eſt foemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino,</hi> ſays the Father of Philoſophy. But if a man is never ſo little juſt, he muſt grant that all theſe priviledges ſingly refer themſelves to the intellect and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the mind. The Siences, 'tis true, are above their reach. They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves in this reſpect to be much inferiour to men: And confeſs that they are born for other things. Not but that this rare <hi>Genius,</hi> who deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be called by a famous Author the Tenth Muſe,<note place="margin">Opuſc.

               </note> and who in our age has proved the glory of her ſex, has ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in a very convincing manner, by a diſcourſe expreſly made, that Fathers and Mothers are guilty of an extream injuſtice for allotting them the Spindle and the Needle, when they are by nature as well fitted for Arts and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines as Men, if they were puſh'd on. Be it as it will, the eſſential perfection of a reaſonable creature doth nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:108454:89"/>in humane Sciences. Oftentimes they are more injurious than profitable. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flat Scientia,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul. Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia mundi docet vanitatem;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bern Cant.</note> 
               <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia carnis voluptatem,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> And it is perhaps for this reaſon, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> alledges by way of Paradox,
<q>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis certain then, that what diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es man from Woman is not what is moſt important in him, but what he has in community with her; that is to ſay, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and Vices, which are of the nature of all kinds, of all Sexes, and of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. <hi>Virtus &amp; Malitia determinat nobiles &amp; ignobiles, ſervos &amp; liberos,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teaches. Now 'tis undeniable, that the man has not more of one, and leſs of others, than the woman. One may even affirm, that he has leſs vertue, and more vice. Firſt, ſince he is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject more noble, and enlightned; vice is incomparably more notorious in him, than in the woman, as <hi>Juveual</hi> ſays,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:108454:89"/>
               <q>
                  <l>Omne animi vitium tantô conſpectius in ſe.</l>
                  <l>Crimen habet, quanto major, qui peccat, habetur.</l>
               </q> All Vices are more conſpicuous and crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as the party offending is more or leſs great.</p>
            <p>I remark in the ſecond place, that men are really much more criminal than women, not only becauſe they ought to be much more vertuous, and that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence has one degree of iniquity in them which is not in the women, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they commit much more, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a more egregious manner. This is ſo true, that in the third place, the men are themſelves guilty of the moſt part of the failings of women. If theſe are in any wife ill humour'd, the men ought to impute the cauſe thereof to their own proper conduct, which is very often full of Tyranny, Contempt, and Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And if they diſpoſe themſelves ſometimes to vicious exceſſes, it is either becauſe they give them an example, or becauſe they ſolicit them with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt application. Poſſibly they are not altogether inſenſible of the darts of love. It may be too, that the tenderneſs of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:108454:90"/>their hearts, and the ſweetneſs of their Conſtitution, is often fatal to them in this reſpect. 'Tis well known that they are not Angels, but infirm and ſinful creatures. Nevertheleſs one may judge how diſcreet they would be, were it not for the cruel perſecutions of men, by the difficulty of ſubduing the <hi>Daphne</hi>'s, the <hi>Io</hi>'s, the <hi>Danae</hi>'s, and the <hi>Europa</hi>'s, even by the Gods <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yes, Sir, make no doubt hereof: It is a manifeſt truth, that the greateſt part of women, either debauch'd, or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, are made ſo by the wickedneſs of Men. If women were allowed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their natural Inclinations, and their charms did not excite againſt them the paſſion of Men; I am perſwaded they would go in the high road to vertue, without turning to the right, or to the left. 'Tis true, if they obſerv'd in us the fame attractions we obſerve in them, they would perhaps be otherwiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd: But they diſcover none: Or if they do, it muſt be granted that they have more ſtrength of mind, than we, to ſurmount the temptations. What is certain herein is, that they are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:108454:90"/>enough upon the Score of Love. Their great infirmity is not in loving, but in deſiring to be beloved, and to ſtudy to appear amiable, in order to procure themſelves hearts. They love to hear men talk things relating to their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But they do not willingly give them an opportunity of talking; yet I confeſs, that they who know how to prevail over this infirmity of the Sex, which makes them covet incenſe and cajoling, at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine them to their Laws, and get above their conſtancy. But why ſhould we attribute to them the crime of Men? Why do they employ means to corrupt them? why do they practiſe ſo many ſtratagems to make them forget their duty? Why do they putt things in their mind, which they would never have thought on? why do they abuſe their ſimplicity? Doth it not ill become the men after this to accuſe them of indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and to aſperſe their honour? They, who made them faulty in ſpite of themſelves; they, who are the real cauſe of the crimes which they commit in this reſpect: In a word, they who are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more culpable, than the women.</p>

            <p> I affirm as much of their humour. If there are amongſt them ſuch as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy, and of a difficult acceſs, I cannot abſtain from ſaying that the greateſt part of Husbands make them ſo. How many of them are there, who treat their wives like ſlaves, and imagine to themſelves that they are only born for ſervitude? Hearken, I beſeech you, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint which they make in a Poet touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unhappineſs of their fate: <q>Muſt it not be granted, ſay they, that of all creatures we are the moſt unfortunate? after having purchaſed a Husband dear enough, he muſt be the diſpoſer of our Bodies and Eſtates. It's neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that with his perſon we eſpouſe his Inclinations, and undergo that yoak he is pleas'd to impoſe upon us.. He acts with impunity what we cannot do without loſs of Fame. If he diſapproves of us, he has the liberty to forſake us. Whatſoever evils we endure with him, we muſt in no wiſe think of a Separation. Divorces are indecent in women. When Domeſtick affairs ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed amiſs, he goes to find his conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation abroad. He walks, he diverts himſelf, he frequents good Societies.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:108454:91"/>He viſits his friends. He diſperſes by this means all his vexations. But as for us we muſt digeſt them alone. We are unable to ſeek any alleviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but in our ſelves. If we do any thing that's well, no notice is taken of it; but if any diſaſter arrives to the family, we are preſently to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Our pains are ſufficiently known in producing and educating Children, and in the management of all Domeſtick affairs, whilſt our husbands are pleaſing themſelves, and conſider only many times how to rejoyce. How deplorable eſpecially is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when by falſe ſuſpicions againſt our conduct, they become jealous: Or elſe by their courſes they oblige us to prove ſo? Were we as fair and compleat as Angels, they will not ceaſe to be weary of us, and to deſpiſe us, as if we were the moſt deformed. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt heat of their Love is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd in our boſoms, and they have ſatisfi'd the deſire of their fleſh, they laugh at us, and contemns their promiſes.</q>

            <p>As for me, I confeſs ingenuouſly, that this complaint is juſt, and that ſhe had reaſon to ſay of her own Sex,

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But I alledge at the ſame time, that the men are unjuſt and ungrateful to complain, ſo much as they do, of the ill humour of their wives; to ſay ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſobliging things of them, and to attribute to them all the Severities of Marriage. Beſides, that they ought to hold them very much excuſed in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their frailty: I affirm that the chiefeſt part of their evil conducts is derived leſs from their fault, than that of their husbands. Generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Wives have much more vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and much leſs pleaſure.</p>
            <p>How many husbands ruin their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:108454:92"/>every day by gaming? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are ſtarved by their filthy Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? How many of them are undoen by miſchievous affairs, and deſtructive corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencies, from which their wives might have diverted them, if they had been made acquainted with their deſigns? After all this, can the Wives be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrued if Patience eſcapes them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times? if they are not always good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd, and it happens that they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to murmur and complain of theſe ill husbands, who by their unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct render their lives inſupportable? O Detractors! aſſert as long as you will that they are cruel, and violent: As for me, I find that they are but little ſo, in regard of the occaſion they have.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, we may juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the women by way of exception. They who condemn them ſo magiſterial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are men; that is to ſay, they are really parties, and by conſequence very ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judges; or to ſay better, they cannot be their Judges. They have an ample right to challenge them: They are too much intereſſed in this proceſs, to have the deciſion referred to them. As pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:108454:93"/>as they are againſt the Sex, how ſhould they give an equitable judgment? They only act in paſſion here, which ought to make one preſume the injuſtice of their Sentiments. If Oracles or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes had pronounced a Sentence to the diſadvantage of Women, one ought, I confeſs, to have ſome deference for their teſtimony: But thoſe are neither Gods, nor Demi-Gods, that ſlander them ſo much. They are very Men, and amongſt them the leaſt ſincere, ſuch as Poets are. That which one of them aſſerted of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, may be alledged of all,
<q>Magnaque pars mendax ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum eſt,<note place="margin">Ovid. Triſt. L. 2.</note> &amp; ficta meorum.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus nothing obliges us to beleive them, eſpecially in their Satyrical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations againſt the Sex; for it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in this regard that they have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Fables and Romances.</p>
            <p>Let us ſpeak things as they are, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of both ſexes is extream. One may equally apply to both, that thundring Sentence of the Scripture, <hi>All the thoughts of the heart of Man are evil continually.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> But if a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:108454:93"/>man would ſpeak ſincerely, he would freely acknowledge that the Female Sex is leaſt corrupted, and that it ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſome relicks of its original inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. When a man has regard only to the ſweetneſs of the temper of women, and to that gentleneſs of Soul which is ſo natural to them, ſhould he not be perſwaded that they have much fewer evil qualities than men?</p>
            <p>There are ſome notwithſtanding, 'tis true, who are inſupportable; and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories give us an account of ſome, who are capable of frightning all ſingle men, ſuch as the wife of <hi>Job,</hi> and that of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</hi> But theſe are exceptions to the general rule, which are not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. There would be no juſtice in referring to all the crime of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <q>Cur omnium fit culpa, paucorum Scelus.</q>
            <p>May we not aſſert likewiſe of Men, what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid of women, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt a thouſand 'twou'd be a hard matter to find one perfect? <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſought after him heretofore with his eyes ſhut, and a Lanthorn in his hand at full Noon, to let us know that it was impoſſible to find him.</p>
            <pb n="182" facs="tcp:108454:94"/>
            <p> Moreover to apprehend rightly the thought of <hi>Solomon,</hi> it is not ſo diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to the Sex, as 'tis imagined. He ſpeaks of a thouſand men with regard to the thouſand Concubines he had. It is as if he had ſaid, if I had a thouſand Men to examine, ſure I ſhould find one very reaſonable. But, O Affliction! a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt an equal number of women whom I have choſen, I have not found one perfect, and free from great defects. One may obſerve that he doth not ſpeak of women in general, but of his women in particular. How can any one attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to him the belief of not one good woman, he that in ſo many places makes the Encomium of vertuous women; that ſpeaks of them in ſuch honourable terms, and exhorts thoſe men ſo often whom God has favoured with them, to praiſe him inceſſantly for it? As for his own, I conteſt not but he had reaſon to judge of them as he did. It is perhaps the moſt unworthy part of the triumphant Reign of <hi>Solomon,</hi> to have taken ſuch a prodigious multitude of women for his uſe, againſt the expreſs Law of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. But to this firſt offence he added ſtill that of taking almoſt all of them
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:108454:94"/>out of the boſom of Paganiſm; which was no leſs prohibited to the <hi>Jews.</hi> Who makes any doubt of Gods being high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incenſed at ſuch a proceeding?</p>
            <p>It may be that to puniſh <hi>Solomon</hi> he purpoſely ſuffered all his women to be of a diſingenious temper. We may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry boldly ſay they were very wicked, ſince they laid ſnares for him even to his Death. <hi>His Women,</hi> ſays the Scripture,<note place="margin">1 Kings<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>made him turn his heart after other Gods in the time of his old age.</hi> The impoſing charms of his women, and the inventions of their mind, made him fall into this Misfortune. As he foreſaw that he ſhould have much adoe to get rid of their ambuſhes in this reſpect, he pronounced this Sentence againſt them by anticipation, I never found a good woman. He had reaſon with relation to his own women, but one muſt not extend his thoughts to all women, as if he would have ſaid that there are none good in the world, which never fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his mind, and which is likewiſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry repugnant to the truth of things. The Wives of the ancient <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> an
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:108454:95"/>a <hi>Vaſti,</hi> a <hi>Suſanna,</hi> an <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> a <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi> a <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> a <hi>Penelope,</hi> a <hi>Paulina,</hi> a <hi>Lucretia,</hi> an <hi>Arria,</hi> and a hundred o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whereof our ſacred and prophane Hiſtories make mention, ſufficiently make appear that a wiſe and vertuous woman is not ſo uncommon, as 'tis imagined: And that even the ſight of them is not difficult, if a man would give himſelf the trouble of ſeeking after them, as he ought.</p>
            <p>Above all it's very difficult to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Enemies of Women, when they declaim againſt their Chaſtity. Is it not ridiculing God and Men, to cry them down in a particular wherein they are ſo worthy of our Praiſes? What's more natural to them than this admirable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which they pretend women ſeldom have? How many ſtratagems, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cares, how many artifices muſt a man uſe in order to obtain their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours? Who can be ignorant that they make all their Joy conſiſt in the ſingle poſſeſſion of their Husbands?</p>

            <p> Is it not apparent that a woman or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſees, without emotion, and with unactive ſenſe, the handſom'ſt men of the world? and that as the Sun, who whilſt he burns the earth is never infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med within his own Sphere, ſhe likewiſe burns without receiving heat?

            <p>Harbour not an opinion, Sir, that my Adverſaries are better grounded in the Second, than in the firſt part of their Criticks: They reaſon equally amiſs in both.

            <p>Firſt, ſay they, Marriage is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Man. It puts him in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the rank of Beaſts. Secondly, it is repugnant to his happineſs, becauſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:108454:96"/>deprives him of liberty, without which he can never be happy. What propoſitions are here! Is it not formally to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſays of Marriage, That it is honourable for all Men?

This precept of a true Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>Doce facienda, &amp; doce faciendo,</hi> has no relation to them. They teach, but they don't act.

            <p>In my ſecond part, I have ſhewn you perſons ſo poſſeſſed with the love of Women, that they declare themſelves incapable of withſtanding them, They argue for nothing but their neceſſity. Behold now ſome, who are directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to them. They are for diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with their abſence. They maintain that they are not neceſſary. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety! A man needs only to conſult with himſelf in order to judge that theſe laſt are even more unreaſonable than the firſt. For theſe are at leaſt more ſincere. They ſpeak according to their Sentiments. <hi>Concordat Sermo cum vitâ.</hi> They talk as they live. But thoſe are Impoſtors, who feel not what they ſpeak, but would be taken for perſons much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:108454:99"/>above the paſſions, when they are oftentimes enſlaved to them. Their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimultation doth not ceaſe to procure them praiſes. Men, who examine but the outſide, and who only judge of things by appearances, imagine that there are heroical and very extraordinary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in them, Which made <hi>Virgil</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,

            <p>So much is Vertue deſpiſed, and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity out of uſe in the world.</p>
            <p>To enter into the bottom of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, I make a propoſition directly contrary to that of my Adveriaries. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, ſay they, is not agreeable to man. It is for his glory not to marry. And I affirm, that Marriage doth agree with Man It is neceſſary for him. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well forbear it. The firſt part of this work very clearly proves the truth of my Propoſition; ſince God has inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Marriage; ſince our Saviour has
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:108454:99"/>confirm'd it; ſince the Apoſtles have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended it, ſince all Nations of the World have practiſed it, ſince it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys to man ſuch great advantages, can one doubt of its agreement with him? and if it is thus excellently good, as I have maintain'd it all along, can one aſſert that it is unworthy of man?</p>
            <p>But let us ſee the Reaſons, upon which it's Adverſaries rely in order to cry it down. They all return to theſe three. Firſt, It is repugnant to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Reaſon over the Senſes and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Secondly, It puts man in the rank of Beaſts. Laſtly, it hinders him from reſembling the Angels. One may reply to all this in few words. What Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick is this! Reaſon is in man what the King is in the State. It ought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all to it ſelf, and to ſubmit it ſelf to nothing. All the paſſions ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to it, but it ſhould never yield it ſelf to any of them. Therefore Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age doth not agree with Man. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man ought not to marry. Can there be more miſerable arguing? One grants the Principle. Reaſon ought to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:108454:100"/>govern the paſſions. It ought to be the Miſtreſs. But where have theſe men learnt that Marriage is contrary to its Sovereignty? One may from this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple infer concluſions abſoluetly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to theirs. Reaſon ought to govern the paſſions, by conſequence Marriage is neceſſary for Man. Why? becauſe the Paſſions are much ſtronger in Celibacy, than in Marriage; becauſe Marriage is it ſelf a means to tame the Paſſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Reaſon governs them, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently? with more eaſineſs. But ſay they, it ought to triumph over them. It ought to captivate them. Reaſon ought, that I may ſo ſpeak, to ſwallow up the paſſions. This is an evil Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine equally unknown in the School of God, and that of Men. The paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are good in themſelves. They are become criminal only by the pollution of Sin, which has diſorder'd them. Man muſt not be abſolutely diſpoſſeſs'd of them; they are eſſential to him: He cannot even live with integrity, according to St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> without their aſſiſtance. <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus animi qui non habent, recte non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vunt.</hi> The Indolence of the Stoicks has been at all times condemned. Man nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:108454:101"/>it, that Marriage is very worthy of man, and abſolutely neceſſary for him, even according to their own principle.</p>
            <p>As animal as the action of Marriage is, it is notwithſtanding very conformable to right Reaſon and the Nature of man. One may ſay that man is a mixt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. He is neither all Fleſh, nor all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he is a <hi>compoſitum</hi> of both. He has a Body, he has a Soul. Each of theſe two parts of this Being applies it ſelf to thoſe objects which are ſuitable to it, and agreeable to its Nature. As the Soul is of a coeleſtial and immaterial Original, its ſingle proſpect is, to exalt it ſelf above ſenſible things. But the body, which is terreſtrial, follows its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural deſtination. All it's motions tend downward. It propoſes to it ſelf no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the enjoyment of Creatures. Man by his Soul has the honour to be the Image of God, and the Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Angels. But indeed by his Body, he enters in ſome ſort in communion of Nature and Society with Beaſts. He doth in this regard what they do. The ſame accidents happen to him. He has the ſame deſires. He is touched with
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:108454:101"/>the ſame Objects, ans has no priviledge over them in this reſpect. Thoſe anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Heroes, who gave terror and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration to the whole world, by the force of their judgments, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of their Genius, have not fail'd to be ſubject to the concupiſcible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, as well as the vileſt of animals. After having equal'd themſelves to the Gods in the ſuperior part of their being, they muſt reſemble beaſts by the inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable Law of the inferior part. I confeſs that it is very mortifying, for the King of Animals not to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd herein from his Subjects, and to encreaſe after the ſame manner and by the ſame ways, as they. But be not ſurprized at it. This was neceſſary for the deſign of their common Creator. He has of a ſudden and without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Sex form'd that innumerable multitude of Spirits, which compoſe the Hierarchy of Angels and Devils, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being incorruptible intelligences they were by conſequence incapable of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But God having been pleaſed to make all human-kind of one blood, as the Apoſtle ſays, and by way of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, it was neceſſary to give to Man,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:108454:102"/>an Organized body. It was neceſſary to render him capable of multiplying. It was expedient for him to make two Sexes. In a word, it was convenient to give them that natural deſire of uniting together, which makes the propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the kind, but which is never law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful without Marriage. Can one aſſert after this, that it is unworthy of man with relation to this Union of Sexes? As deſpicable as it is in it ſelf, is it not ſufficient that it is the deſign of Nature, and the very order of God, who has commanded us to encreaſe and multiply, in order to raſe all the Scandal, which the moſt ſcrupulous perſons might receive from thence? As I have already ſaid, it is as conformable to reaſon, as agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the nature of man. Reaſon it ſelf diſpoſes men to it. In general it approves of all that is deſign'd by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. And in particular it ſuffers man to practiſe all that tends to the good and preſervation of his being. Its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is not to diſpoſſeſs him of a deſire ſo eſſential to him as that is, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reduce it to its juſt meaſure, and to bring it back to lawful uſe. Thus we may affirm, that this Union is no
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:108454:102"/>leſs neceſſary to the world, than drinking and eating, and all other animal functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Let us ſay then by conſequence-that it contains nothing unworthy of us, provided that Reaſon conducts the paſſion to it, and that the paſſion is not without reaſon therein. In all this we ſhall affirm what is true.</p>
            <p>But ſay they, the State of a Batchellor makes us reſemble Angels and Saints. It is by conſequence in man an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perfection. I deny, that a Celibacy purely corporeal is a perfection, and that it likens us to Angels and Saints: Since marriage is of the order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the inſtitution of God, and the duty of man, purſuant to the proofs I have brought, how ſhould a ſingle ſtate which is directly oppoſite to it, be of it ſelf a vertue? It is exactly with Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy, as with a Faſt. What is more indifferent, than to eat and drink? Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting is only conſiderable becauſe the Church recommends the practice of it, and may contribute much to the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Vices, and the encreaſe of their Vertues: But no body ever ſaid that it was a Vertue in it ſelf. They,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:108454:103"/>who remain in a ſingle ſtate with that wiſdom preſcribed by the Goſpel, are doubtleſs worthy of our praiſes; not with relation to Celibacy it ſelf; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may make them ſitter to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the duties of Piety. If Celiba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy were a vertue, then Marriage muſt be a crime. It is indeed what the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainiſts</hi> and other Hereticks formerly taught; But St. <hi>Paul</hi> puts this Doctrine amongſt thoſe of the Devils: And it is a long time ſince the Church thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruck it with its Anathema's. As for thoſe happy Virgins of the <hi>Revelations</hi> who follow the Lamb every where, and who were never defil'd with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, what follows, and what precedes, moſt clearly juſtifies; that one muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that to a ſence purely ſpiritual and metaphorical. 'Tis evident, and the Text ſays it, that the holy Spirit means by theſe Virgins the 144000 mark'd out, who in the ſame Book re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd faithful to the Lamb,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4.</note> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never proſtituted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Idolatries and Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of thoſe Myſtical women, who were to make all the Earth drunk with the wine of their whoredoms, but having
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:108454:103"/>only followed <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in his Word, and in the practice of the Precepts of his Goſpel. This therefore makes neither for Celibacy nor againſt Marriage. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogſt thoſe Virgins there might be as many married, as ſingle. All the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Celibacy over Marriage, is, that they who make a good uſe of it, may find more eaſineſs to ſerve God, and avoid divers inconveniencies to which married perſons are ſubject. But beſides that each State has its own difficulty, as I have made appear, how much hazard doth a man run in that of Celibacy by the almoſt inſuperable difficulty of fulfilling all its duties? who knows not what St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſays of the Empire of our bodies over our Souls; <hi>Corpus trahit animam in regionem ſuam?</hi> Who is ignorant with what rapidity the paſſions draw us along? who is not ſenſible that it is of no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, to have a purity of body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cleanneſs of Soul? who knows not, in a word, to ſpeak with St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that an humble Marriage is of much more value, than a proud Virginity? <hi>Melius eſt humile conjugium, quàm ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba Virginitas</hi>

            <p> You ſee, Sir, how fallacious the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is, that the Enemies of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage would draw from this principle, and that nothing is more miſerable than the reaſoning they make, in order to ſuſtain that it is unworthy of man.

            <p>'Tis granted, that Marriage puts men under engagements, which come very mear to ſervitude. But, Sir, you muſt not think that there is no ſervitude, but what is ſcandalous, and contrary to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:108454:105"/>Don't you konw, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that to ſerve God is to reign. It the ſame with Marriage in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. It is a ſervitude, I confeſs; but it is a volutary one. It gives a right of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Sovereignty. It is rewarded with a thouſand charms, which are not to be found in the liberty of a ſingle life. What do you apprehend this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be? It is for the moſt part no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a pure licentiouſneſs. Doth it not appear how the greateſt part of Batchelors live? They are not confined to one woman, but are concatenated by a thouſand criminal paſſions. <hi>Seneca</hi> the Philoſopher conceiv'd nothing to be more infamous, than the ſervitude of a Voluptuous Perſon. <hi>Nulla ſervitus tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pior eſt quam voluptaria.</hi> Theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons imagine themſelves to be free, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not ſubject to the Law of Marriage. But doth not the ſame thing happen to them exactly, which fell out to thoſe Fools, whom <hi>Horace</hi> ſpeaks of,
<q>
                  <l>

            <pb n="205" facs="tcp:108454:105"/>
            <p> They think to avoid one Slavery, and fall into another which is worſe. They fly from that of Marriage which is noble, and conformable to the Nature of Man, and take up that of Vices, which diſhonours them, and is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Grace of our Saviour. For in Fine, one muſt not be deceived. As a good man is free, altho' he ſerves, ſo a man that's free, who indulges his luſts, is a real ſlave. Theſe are two things equally certain. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> eſtabliſhes the one, <hi>Bonus, etiam ſi ſerviat, liber eſt,</hi> ſays he: and <hi>Cicero</hi> eſtabliſhes the other in theſe words, <hi>Liber eſt exiſtimandus, qui nulli turpitudini ſervit.</hi> Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more virtuous a man is, the more he is free, it neceſſarily follows that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is a leſs Servitude than Celibacy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe who are married have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally more vertue than ſingle perſons. Add, Sir, that as thorny as this ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is, one doth not ceaſe to be pleaſed with it. One of the greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities one finds in it, is, even the fear of its not continuing long enough. A husband and a wiſe, that love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cannot reflect without trouble up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their future ſeparation. They had
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:108454:106"/>rather dy, than live apart. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule of the Roman Orator, one ſhould not call the yoak of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage incommodious or tireſom, ſince one bears it with an eaſineſs. <hi>Onus,</hi> ſays he, <hi>non eſt appellandum, quod cum laetitiâ fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras ac voluptate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socrates</hi> being ask'd which was beſt, Marriage, or a ſingle Life, made this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; Marry, or marry not, thou ſhalt ever repent. It's true, that there are in both conditions ſubjects of vexations and diſpleaſures. I even confeſs that one may meet with much more in that of Marriage, than in that of Celibacy. But in recompence, the ſatisfactions a man taſts in Marriage, are much more pure and ſenſible, which I have made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the firſt parts of this work. The peace which ſucceeds a long and cruel war, is ſo much the more ſweet and reliſhing: And after the experience of rough tempeſts, one finds the Calm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely better. The repoſe of Celiba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is a repoſe of ſoftneſs, ſecurity and ſelf love: By conſequence it is a fatal, and deceitful repoſe. There is none real or agreeable, ſays <hi>Seneca,</hi> but that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:108454:106"/>which comes from reaſon. <hi>Nulla pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cida quies eſt, niſi quam ratio compoſuit.</hi> The trouble of Marriage, on the other ſide, is a trouble of ſafety, magnanimity, and courage. <hi>Aſpera vita, ſed ſalubris.</hi> It is of that one may truly ſay, <hi>Sic itur ad aſtra.</hi> It is the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; very difficult.

            </q>
            <p>It degenerates into Vice, when it has no adverſary to encounter. But I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that there is no condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Vertues have a more lawful and advantagious exerciſe than Marriage. Admit that a perſon ſhould not taſt thoſe real pleaſures I have ſpoken of, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe vexations he may meet with, yet he ought not to deſiſt inrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelf under it's diſcipline; ſince it is ſo proper to illuſtrate it's vertues, and to direct him to Salvation.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the difficulties of Marriage, I allow the Education and Eſtabliſhment of Children to be one of the chief. It's
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:108454:107"/>neceſſary for that end to obſerve ſuch cares, which very often renders life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly uneaſy. But after all, ſince man is born for trouble, and that he is ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal <hi>Onerificum,</hi> as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calls him, can he undertake a more lawfull one, or for a nobler ſubject? That Maxim of <hi>Seneca,</hi> is here natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally applied, <hi>Non eſt viri timere ſudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem?</hi> Is it humane to fear the fatigue of making men? Is it the part of a man to continue in Celibacy, in order to avoid the real occupations of man? or in a word, to fly from Marriage through the fear of diſcharging one of the principal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of humanity, and of anſwering the firſt end of Nature?</p>
            <p>I have yet two things to reply to the enemies of Marriage, upon the ſubject of children: One is, that ſloth and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are the moſt ſhameful things to man in the world: And the other is, that nothing is more capable of diſpoſing him to it, than the want of Children. Theſe two propoſitions are of a ſenſible truth. As to the firſt, An Apoſtle tells us in expreſs terms, that he who doth not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that is, remains without action, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:108454:107"/>himſelf to no trouble, is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to eat. In effect, it has been very properly ſaid, <hi>Nihil agendo homines ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lè agere diſcunt.</hi> By doing nothing one learns to do what's ill. Idleneſs cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts bodies, as want of motion infects Rivers.</p>

               <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> were deſtroyed hereby. One cannot therefore too ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ſhun it. I ſay in the ſecond place, that nothing can be imagined more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual againſt it, than a Marriage fruitful in Children; When a man is alone, and has nothing to think of but himſelf, he is ſcarce moved for what's to come.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:108454:108"/>He flies from labour, and applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the diverſions of a licentions life. But when God has given you Heirs to ſucceed you in your Fortunes, you muſt neceſſarily mind ſomewhat elſe. You muſt conſider them, as well as your ſelf. Our Children are our firſt Creditors. They are born ſuch. We owe to them naturally Subſiſtence and Education. We muſt labour all our lives to acquit our ſelves of that debt. St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſays that riches are a pain to thoſe who have no children, <hi>Quibus deficit ſoboles ſua poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia poena eſt.</hi> But I add, that poverty is doubly one to thoſe who want them. Poor men have occaſion for them to be a continual motive to them to exerciſe and practiſe all honeſt means towards the delivering them out of their miſeries. It is perhaps for this reaſon that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are uſually termed their Riches. Thus Children are neceſſary to all the world, and to deprive ones ſelf of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage through the fear of having them, is to ſhut ones Ears againſt the voice of Nature, and that of Providence.</p>
            <p>There remains nothing more but to anſwer the objection, which is made
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:108454:108"/>concerning the ill humour of Wives, and domeſtick Quarrels. Without diſpute this is what's moſt uneaſy in marriage. When once diviſion is introduced, and one comes to diſputes, thorns ariſe on all ſides. What injuſtice is it, ſaid a Malecontent with a grace, to deny that Marriage is a Sacrament, ſince one finds but too often a double one therein: That of Repentance being almoſt always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from it. But, Sir, let not this amaze you. As one uſually ſays, there is a remedy for all things, but death. The laſt part of this Treatiſe will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther convince you hereof, in relation to Marriage. If it could be even ſuſtain'd, that there is no Marriage happy enough to be perfectly exempted from vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, remember that all humane conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are liable thereto, that they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to be born in that of Marriage, than in all others; and that it is our duty to ſuffer patiently thoſe croſſes, which are derived to us from a ſubject where we have found a thouſand Charms.</p>
            <p>In ſome reſpects women may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious, I deny it not; ſome of them are very troubleſom, and render the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:108454:109"/>of that pleaſure, which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, very dear. At the ſame time, if one examines the thing without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, one ſhall find that a woman pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures infinitely more good to the man, than ſhe can do ill. Beſides, it is unjuſt, ſays <hi>Lactantius,</hi> to pretend to exact of any one an impoſſibility. <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quum eſt enim ut id exigas,</hi>

               <hi>quod praeſtare ipſe non poſſis.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this is the humour of the men. They would have women to be without any ſort of defect. They maintain, they ſhould be as perfect as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. They propoſe that with the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Helena,</hi> they ſhould have the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Penelope,</hi> and the wiſdom of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia.</hi> In a word, they would have them to act nothing againſt their duty; and to be ſo far Miſtriſſes of their paſſions, that they ſhould never be able to ſay, do, or think any thing that might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of pleaſing them.</p>
            <p>What injuſtice is here! can the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandants practiſe it themſelves? Is it not a thing above humanity? Since then we cannot be without defects, we ought to love one another with them. The
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:108454:109"/>man ſhould charitably bear with thoſe of the woman, and the woman thoſe of the man. Every one has his own. You will find them every where. If you do not ſuffer thoſe of a wife, you will have thoſe of a Friend, thoſe of a Domeſtick, thoſe of all the world to bear; and ſhould you be delivered from them, you would have ſtill your own to ſuffer, which would be ſo much the more inſupportable, in that having none but them to think of, they will appear to you infinitely more worthy of your horrour. What the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts remark, that the ſame ſoil which produces Poiſons, likewiſe brings forth remedies for them, may be very well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the wife. If ſhe be to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band a cauſe of diſquiet, ſhe is likewiſe to him one of joy. If ſhe afflicts him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, ſhe comforts him much oftner. If ſhe diſpleaſes you in one kind, how agreeable doth ſhe appear to you in a hundred others? in reſpect of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences one has with her, I confeſs that nothing is more affecting at the time, and that there never was a fruit of ſo unreliſhing a taſt. But happily they do not continue long. <hi>Faciles conjugum ſunt reconciliationes.</hi> One night, ſays the

All that I have ſaid hitherto neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes one well done, and well conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. To this is referrable all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which I have declared to be found in a conjugal union.

               </gap>cceſs both for them, and for you. I hope it will perfectly convince you, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more advantagious for man, than a good Marriage. What one ought to do in order to marry, and what one ought to do in Marriage, are the two
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:108454:111"/>points, which I propoſe to explain, in order to ſatisfy my Engagement, and your Expectation.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that an honeſt man ſhould do, after he is determined for Marriage, is to requeſt of God a wife according to his mind. Remember, Sir, that Providence is concerned in every thing, and that there is nothing here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but it diffuſes its influences upon. As corrupted as the <hi>Pagan</hi> Theology was, yet the <hi>ſine Deo nihil feliciter ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedit,</hi> was one of its Maxims. What elſe was that Fortune to which even <hi>Cicero</hi> ſubjects all. Events, and which he regards as the Sovereign Empreſs of the world, <hi>Fortuna Domina rerum,</hi> but that particular conduct of God towards all creatures, which we adore under the name of Providence?</p>
            <p>After having asked of God a wife according to his mind, he ought under the protection of Providence to ſeek one after his own. This, Sir, imports two things; the one is, that ſhe be pleaſing to his Eyes: And the other, that ſhe
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:108454:112"/>be agreeable to his humour. Behold what is moſt eſſential to obſerve, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to marry well. I confeſs he ſhould not eſpouſe a perſon through the ſingle motive of her Beauty. It is too frail a quality to have an entire dependance on.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Nec ſemper viola, nec ſemper lilia florent:<note place="margin">Ovid. de Att. am. l. 2.</note>

               <l>Et riget amiſſa ſpina relict ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays, <hi>Formae dignitas aut morbo defloreſcit, aut Vetuſtate.</hi> The worſt is, that when this happens, the wife is eaſily contemned. As ſhe was only taken for her Beauty, that's no ſooner gone, but ſhe is valued no longer. Her ſight fatigues the Eyes, and as much as ſhe was loved being handſom, ſo much is ſhe diſregarded when ſhe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of ſuch a charm.</p>
            <p>What Mortification is it to a husband, when he finds himſelf compell'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like a Companion, with whom he ought to paſs all his days? It is then certain, that he ſhould not fix his utmoſt bliſs in
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:108454:112"/>Beauty, ſince it may be loſt every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memt.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs it muſt be granted, that nothing is more amiable in nature, nor more proportion'd to the heart of man, to ſpeak with <hi>Plato.</hi> I have told you more than once, that the Gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have been affected with them. Beauty has been always reverenced. The greateſt <hi>Barbarians</hi> have ſacrificed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its Altars. If according to <hi>Juvenal,</hi> it can hardly conſiſt with wiſdom,
<q>Rara eſt adeò concordia formae Atque pudicitiae.<note place="margin">Juv. Sat. 10.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is becauſe 'tis too much lov'd by men, and is continually in proſpect to irregular paſſion, for otherwiſe far from being of it ſelf a Vice, it ſeems to give a new luſtre to Vertue.</p>

            </q>
            <p>I will add yet ſomething more, that in a fair body is generally lodg'd a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoul. It is uncommon enough to ſee
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:108454:113"/>a handſom perſon abſolutely wicked. Sweetneſs and Honeſty ſeem to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperable from Beauty. Thus it well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that man ſhould give it the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and that he ſhould ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it with ſome care, when he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to marry. What ſatisfaction is it to have a wife, whoſe ſight alone is capable of delighting you, and whom you judge worthy of your love, even when ſhe has deſerved your hatred!</p>
            <q>Facta merent odium: Facies exorat amorem.<note place="margin">Ovid. amor. L. 3. El. 10.</note>
            </q>
            <p>I confeſs all women are not handſom, and that the number of thoſe who are ſo, is ſmall in compariſon of thoſe who are not. But, Sir, by a very particular Providence, in this as well as in all other things, every one has his fancy. That which diſpleaſes one, is pleaſing to another. All men do not reſpect women with the ſame eye, nor in the ſame manner. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more various, than the Judgment they make of them. If ſome pay their vows to the fair perſon, how many are ſooneſt reconciled to the brown? Some men are moſt affected with a fat Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:108454:113"/>whilſt others confer the Laurel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſlender one. Several will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine thoſe unhandſom, who will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear agreeable to others. If one can accommodate himſelf only to a finiſh'd Beauty, another ſhall be ſatisfied with a good meen. Thus every one finds where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to indulge himſelf according to his inclination, and the Ideas which he frames of the Sex.</p>
            <p>If it imports, that the Wife ſhould pleaſe the Eyes, it imports ſtill more that ſhe ſhould pleaſe the mind. It is not ſufficient for her to be Handſome, or of a good meen, ſhe ought chiefly to Sympathize with your humour, and that her Manners be conformable to yours.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Without that, you will always diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. You will be in eternal diſputes. Your Marriage will be a ſort of Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, wherein you will be interred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.</p>

            </q>
            <p>It is a thing, 'tis true, wherein one is often deceiv'd, by reaſon of that Art of fiction which is ſo natural to the Sex. It is an ordinary ſaying, That there never was a wicked Maid, becauſe they know how to appear good, when they are not ſo. St. <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> remarks, that Horſes and other Beaſts are always bought upon trial; but that it is not ſo with a Wife. <hi>Sola uxor non oſtenditur ne antè diſpliceat quam ducatur.</hi> If ſhe be violent, haſty, proud, infirm, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever vice ſhe has, we never find it till the Nuptials are over. He would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate hereby, that one runs a great hazard in Marrying; and I deny it not. But without having recourſe either to that proof of ſix Months, practis'd in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi> by certain people of the Earth before Marriage; or to the Letter of divorce amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> which are things directly contrary to the purity of Chriſtianity, it is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conduct ones ſelf in this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Affair with ſome kind of aſſurance, by the means of ſeveral precepts of wiſdom.</p>
            <pb n="223" facs="tcp:108454:114"/>
            <p> That which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives, is to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a young Wife, and one that is a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, in order to the more eaſie forming of her into good Manners. He affords this reaſon elſewhere: <hi>Juvenes non ſunt maligni moris, ſed facilis, propterea quod nondum viderunt nequitias.</hi> It is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that young Women are much more eaſie to modify than others. As they have not yet contracted any evil habits, you may without difficulty inſpire them with good ones. Being ſcarce acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with evil, they may ſo much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuck in the good.</p>
            <q>Dum faciles animi juvenum, dum mobilis aetas.<note place="margin">Virg. 3. Georg.</note>
            </q>
            <p>In effect, it is eaſie to imprint upon a heart the Maxims of Vertue, when it is void of the Maxims of Vice. It were better for a Wiſe to be wanting in ſome of the qualities neceſſary for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a Houſe, than to have thoſe which are capable of making a Husband unhappy. The one may be obtained with Years, but Years do but fortify the others.</p>
            <pb n="224" facs="tcp:108454:115"/>
            <p> If this advice be good, that of <hi>Heſiod</hi> is no leſs. He would have the perſon who is to Marry, take a young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his Acquaintance and Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>I don't know any precept, Sir, more important for practice than this. Why do Marriages ordinarily ſucceed ſo ill? It is becauſe the parties Marry without knowing one another, and without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing whether one be the make of the other One being inchanted with a beauty, which perhaps he never ſaw but once, is ſo tranſported with his love, that he can only ſigh, and live for her, without examining whether ſhe has beſides what a Woman ought to have in order to live contented with her, and without conſidering any thing elſe but to ſatisfy his fooliſh Paſſion, he Marries her. The other through a deſire of being Rich, will moſt willingly accept of ſuch a Perſon who is the worſt ſhap'd, and the leaſt reaſonable in the World, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he may have wherewith to make his Fortune. The greateſt part of Marriages are made either by the interpoſition of another, or for reaſons of wordly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:108454:115"/>One regards the out-ſide, without a thought of what relates to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part. A man examines the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Woman, and is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with her Manners. This without diſpute is the reaſon why ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people are unhappy in the choice they make. The principal thing then is, to ſtudy well the humour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a Woman, in order to know if ſhe has a conformity with yours, and if you could live peaceably together. For this end you muſt not go to ſeek her in a Country remote from you; you muſt, as far as in you lies, take her as it were at your door. It will be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult matter if you ſee her often, and have a little regard to her deportments, not to diſcover at length all that ſhe is.</p>
            <p>Behold, Sir, a third precept, which is yet more aſſured than the other two. Marry a young Lady of good exſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and who belongs to People of an irreproachable Life. This is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Maxim, whoſe truth is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, <hi>viz.</hi> That Children almoſt always reſemble thoſe from whom they deriv'd their being.</p>
            <pb n="226" facs="tcp:108454:116"/>
            <p> I know there are thoſe who degenerate from the vertue of their Anceſtors; but to ſpeak generally, one may ſay, without danger of being decived, Like Father, like Son; like Mother, like Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

            <p> There is nothing that more corrupts our Manners, than Domeſtick ill Examples. Doubtleſs then it would be a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, for an honeſt man to Marry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Family of a bad reputation, and to take the Daughter of a Mother who is either immodeſt, or ſullied with ſome ſcandalous Vice.

Not but that excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to be allowed: The moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule is not excuſed from them. But it may be taken for granted, that this is one of the moſt certain, and that few of thoſe who ſhall practiſe it, will find it unſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>I add, Sir, this Precept to the reſt. In Marrying, affect as much as in you lies an Equality of condition and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. If you take a Wife of a Family more exalted than yours, ſhe will not fail to boaſt of it at your expence, you ſhall be ſufficiently told of the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Original, and the Baſeneſs of your own. Beſides, the certainty of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to her ſelf the right of comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.

            <p>It would be much worſe, if you ſhould Marry one who hath more Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es than your ſelf: Or if being poor, you ſhould take a rich Wife. This is what the Poet calls having loſt his Empire.</p>

            <p>How little is this precept reſpected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men. when a Bachelor ſeeks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Wife, he doth not ask about her Vertues, but her Poſſeſſions. Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:108454:118"/>all his deſires, and the chief feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of <hi>Hymen.</hi> I confeſs that Riches may be very uſeful in Marriage, and that it is very pleaſing to all the World to eſpouſe them with a Wife, when ſhe has beſides all the qualities that are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him, for what has been ſaid of one, is very often but too true:
<q>O ter infelix qui exiſtens pauper ducit ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem!</q>
            </p>
            <p>But Sir, be perſwaded, that Vertue is of infinite more worth without Riches, than Riches without Vertue; they ought never to be the end of Marriage: The ſame Author who ſpeaks of Poverty in ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious a manner, with relation to Marriage, doth not fail to acknowledge that Merit ought to be preferred to Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
<q>Morem praeponere pecuniis ducturum uxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem oportet.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yes without doubt, the beſt porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Wife can bring to a Husband, is the wiſdom of her and her Fathers.</p>
            <pb n="231" facs="tcp:108454:118"/>
            <p> Nothing but this is capable of rendring him happy in the poſſeſſion of a Wife. If you take a Wife upon account of her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, you may aſſure your ſelf that you will never repent of it. She will inceſſantly draw down upon you the bleſſings of Heaven, and you will find your ſelf much happier with ſuch a wife, even in the midſt of indigence, than you would be in the greateſt proſperity with a wife of Gold, but without this precious Vertue. He who enjoys ſuch a one, ſays <hi>Cicero,</hi> has all that is neceſſary to live happily. <hi>In quo virtus ſit eì nihil deeſſe ad beatè vivendum puto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have but one precept more to give you upon this ſubject. Be careful not to marry one againſt her will, who will always have a contempt of you. I will pronounce it boldly, nothing is more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital than that in the deſign of mrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age There are but very few of this kind, which have not very fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. Thinking to entertain in your Bed another ſelf, ſuch a one as a wiſe ought to be, you will lodge there a cruel adverſary, who will every day find a thouſand occaſions to give you ſome diſquiet.</p>

            </q>
            <p>It is the moſt unhappy thing a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be guilty of, to commit violence upon her inclination, and to conſtrain her to eſpouſe a man whom ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love. You will never make her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce her reſentments. This marriage will occaſion to you all the thorns and diſpleaſures, which <hi>Juvenal</hi> repreſents in theſe Verſes:
<q>
                  <l>Semper habet lites, alternaque jurgia lectus,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The wife is a Victim, which ought to go voluntarily to the Altar. Her reſiſtance would be of ill preſage. The offering of her Heart is of more value than all the reſt. If you are not loved by her, you are neceſſarily hated.</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>Aut amat, aut odit mulier. Non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet medium.</hi>

               <l> There's no Medium in a Woman, ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways either loves or hates.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Avoid then, as you would death, a woman in whom you ſee no diſpoſition to love you. Admit her to be exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely fair, unmeaſurably rich, extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly virtuous, ſhe is not fit for you. Of what ſervice is all that to you, if you are the object of her averſion? This e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Sir, is almoſt without remedy. What cares ſoever you may take to win the heart of a wife, who is only yours by the force of paternal Authority, you will find it extreamly difficult to go through with it.</p>
            <p>Never have any thoughts for marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, Sir, unleſs you reſolve to practiſe all theſe precepts. I could add ſtill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others: But theſe are the chief, and they ſuffice to make a good marriage. The miſchief is, that people do not ſtop here, and that almoſt all thoſe who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, act herein by motives diſengaged from the ſubject they look after. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which they take, is a thing of the leaſt regard with them. They are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by particular conſiderations.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:108454:120"/>This enters into their deſign but by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and after the reſt. If ſhe has a Fortune: If ſhe can draw me out of neceſſity: If ſhe belongs to perſons who by their Credit are able to advance me, it is enough, ſays one. I demand no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage. If beſides all this ſhe is handſom, well ſhaped, and vertuous, ſo much the better: It is a double hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs for me. But in caſe this doth not appear, the reſt remaining, I ſhall not fail to marry her. What deſtruction of Maxims and good Senſe! Now certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to chooſe a wife with whom one may propoſe to live happily, a man is only to conſider if ſhe pleaſes him: If ſhe be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, and if ſhe be derived from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt parents. Whether ſhe be rich or poor, it imports not.</p>

               </l>
               <l>This without diſpute is the directeſt way of reaſoning.</l>
            </q>
            <p>After having given you precepts for the attaining to a happy Marriage, it is at preſent neceſſary to afford you ſome in order to live happily therein. They
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:108454:120"/>all conſiſt in the practice of two ſorts of Duties, towards two ſorts of Perſons. The one regard the wife, and the others refer to the Children. The good or evil of marriage proceed alone from theſe two parts. There was reaſon to ſay, <hi>Eſt uxor aut tutum refugium, aut pena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le tormentum.</hi> She is alſo as another Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has it, either the ruine or ſafety of the Family, <hi>Mulier domi damnum eſt aut Salus.</hi> On another ſide, the wiſe man informs us that Children are the Joy or ſorrow of their parents, according as they are well or ill inclined. This ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the matter which remains to be treated of in order to fullfil the deſign of this work, very important. It is, Sir, ſo much the more, in that by acquitting your ſelf of the duties whereof I ſhall diſcourſe, you will make your wife be a bleſſed Fountain to you at all times, to ſpeak with <hi>Solomon.</hi> All the world is not happy enough to meet with this advantage: The Precautions, which one takes for this end, are, I confeſs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times unprofitable: But it is almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, that a wife, who by nature is not very reaſonable, ſhall become ſo if the Husband rules himſelf with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:108454:121"/>to her according to my Inſtructions.</p>
            <p>I begin them, by declaring to you, that if you would be happy in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, you muſt neceſſarily be loved of your wife. You cannot be beloved of her, if you do not love her. Therefore be ſure to love her. This is the firſt Leſſon a Husband ought to learn. It comes from St. <hi>Paul: Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25.28.</note> 
               <hi>love your Wives, as Chriſt loved his Church,</hi> &amp;c. Would you know rhe reaſon? <q>Husbands ought <hi>to love their Wives as their own Bodies;</hi> He that loves his wife, loves himſelf. <hi>No body ever hated his own Fleſh.</hi>
               </q> By con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the Husband ought to love his Wife, for his wife is his own fleſh. They are no more two, but one fleſh. What is more reaſonable than this duty? what ought to be more precious to us, than our ſelves? We ought then in the firſt place to love our wives by a motive of ſelf-love, ſince we cannot love our ſelves, but we muſt love them, being, that I may ſo ſpeak, a part of our own ſubſtance:
<q>Animae dimidium meae.<note place="margin">Horat.</note>
               </q>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:108454:121"/>What a prodigious thing would it be to ſee a man declare himſelf an enemy to himſelf, and to have an averſion for his own perſon? St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, that it was never ſeen, and inſinuates to us that it is a thing not to be ſeen in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature. It is notwithſtanding what arrives to all thoſe who love not their wives.</p>
            <p>A man ought in the ſecond place to love his wife by a Motive either of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Intereſt, or pure acknowldgment. Either ſhe loves you, or ſhe doth not love you. If ſhe loves you, you cannot without ingratitude forbear to love her. On the other ſide if ſhe loves you not, you ought to love her, to the end that ſhe may be won to love you. This Maxim of <hi>Seneca</hi> is of abfolute neceſſity in Marriage: <hi>Si vis amari, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi> Love is gain'd only by Love. It is not to be obtain'd by Force or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence. <hi>Amor extorqueri non poteſt,</hi> ſays <hi>Seneca.</hi> Naturally we love thoſe who love us. If we did otherwiſe, we ſhould be leſs reaſonable than Brutes.</p>

            </q>
            <p>A Philoſopher of old time made theſe Queſtions and Anſwers. What is moſt inſupportable in life? To love without being beloved. What is the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt thing in the world? To be beloved without loving. What is moſt morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to a man? To ſee himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to hate what he has loved. In a word, what is moſt dreadful to him? A love converted into hatred; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo much the more implacable, as the other was paſſionate.</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>Semper bonus amicus gravis iraſcitur.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Our beſt Friends are always the moſt angry with us.</l>
            </q>
            <p>All this, Sir, is true, and theſe are Axioms which make ſo many certain principles in the Morality of Men. A Husband that doth not love, or who loves without being beloved, is equally unhappy. The true ſecret to ſupport patiently the inconveniences of Marriage, and to live happy therein, is to love. Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:108454:122"/>is he who marries without determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to love his wife, and propoſes only to embrace her Riches. <hi>Meipſum igitur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare oportet, non mea, ſi veri amici fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turi ſimus.</hi> There is not a wife but has a right of uſing ſuch language to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, nor a Husband but ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame to his wife.</p>
            <p>After this Rule I cannot give you a better, than to afford your ſelf for an Example to your wife: Of all the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of the Chriſtian Morality, the moſt equitable and moſt certain is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, to do to others what we would have done to our ſelves. Would you be beloved of your wife? Love her. Would you have her wife? Be ſo your ſelf. Would you have her complaiſant to you? Be you the ſame to her. Would you have her make appear a ſweetneſs of Behaviour, and Fidelity in her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct? Make appear the ſame in yours. Nothing is more juſt than this duty, and Husbands are inſupportable to complain of the ill Humours, and untoward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their Wives, if their own is no bettter. One may ſay, that they are in ſome meaſure guilty of their Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:108454:123"/>becauſe they would have perſiſted in wiſdom, if their Husbands had not removed themſelves from it. It is certain, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves, that the wife uſually conforms her ſelf to the manners of her Husband. And <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> informs us, that ſhe will be always chaſt and conſtant to him, if ſhe finds him ſo to her. <hi>Si mulier cognoverit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi caſtum &amp; fidum virum, &amp; ipſa etiam caſta &amp; fida erit.</hi> You will ſay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that this duty is of very difficult Practice, and that it were better not to marry at all, than to conſtrain ones ſelf to this degree. I grant the difficulty. But what? would it not be ſcandalous to omit a thing which is good in it ſelf, and very neceſſary for Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it impoſes an indiſpenſible obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be a good man, and to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Maxims of Vertue? O God! What Chriſtians are we? Is it not a thing which ought on the other ſide to determine men for Marriage? What method is more infallible to withdraw men from Debaucheries, or to prevent them, than Marriage? Doth not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which is owing to a wife and Children, render a Man more circumſpect
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:108454:123"/>in his Conduct? Marriage is Bridle, that keeps men within the bounds of ſanctity, and Motive to eſchew Vices. Is there a ſingle man, who doth not deſire to be wiſe, and to be able to deſerve the Praiſes of a good man? and is not this the true way that directs to it?</p>
            <p>But, Sir, amongſt the Vertues whoſe Example you owe to a wife, you muſt above all things ſtudy to inſpire her with that of devotion. One cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what Good a devout Wife is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing a Husband, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages he may receive from thence. Whether he be ſick or well, rich or poor: In proſperity, or in miſery; in joy, or ſorrow: He will always find in her an aſſiſtance proportioned to his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſomewhere ſays, that Piety is good for every thing. I ſay as much of a devout Wife. Nothing is more Angelical, nothing more excellent. Happy, and thrice happy, may one call that man, to whom Heaven has afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a preſent.</p>
            <p>The exterior Cauſe of Devotion is the frequent Reading Divine Books,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:108454:124"/>and the works of Piety of Eccleſiaſtical Authors. To this, Sir, you ought to turn the genius of your Wife, as much as in you lies. If once ſhe takes a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure herein, 'tis almoſt infallible that ſhe will have a regard to her Salvation, a contempt for the World, and a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour for Sin, which are the eſſential Characters of true devotion. But if this kind of reading be infinitely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to diſpoſe a Wife to wiſdom, that of Romances and Comedies is not leſs effectual to turn her inclination from it. Whatſoever may be ſaid in favour of theſe eloquent fictions, I can aſſure you that nothing is fitter to corrupt the heart and to inflame it with the love of Creatures. If Fathers and Mothers were ſenſible of the pernicious impreſſions, which theſe ſorts of books are capable of giving their Daughters, they would undoubtedly employ all their cares to conceal the very Names from them. Take off your Wife therefore from the humour of reading ſuch books. It is a School wherein ſhe will never fail to learn what will render you unhappy, they will make her wanton, vain, ridiculous, inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable. When ſhe comes to compare
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:108454:124"/>you with thoſe imaginary <hi>Heroes</hi> dreſſed in Romances after the manner of the Gods, ſhe will be apt to eſteem you no longer, you will almoſt neceſſarily become the Object of her contempt. On the other ſide, be careful to put into her hands the Prophets and Apoſtles: Let this be her ordinary Employment. Let her make thereof the whole matter of her diverſion. O Holy and Divine School, where one learns to become like God himſelf, and to practiſe the Duties of an Angelical perfection:</p>
            <p>Prayer is both the principal act of Devotion, and the moſt aſſured means to obtain Grace. Practiſe it, Sir, and make your Wife practiſe the ſame with exactneſs. Accuſtom your ſelf to pray often to God with her in the midſt of your Family: Humble your ſelves often together before that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Majeſty, from whom you expect all your good things, and all your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. Let him hear ſeveral times in a day the voice of your heart with that of your mouth. Repreſent to him all your wants, and make appear in your Prayers a holy ardour, that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:108454:125"/>the zeal of your Wife. Were ſhe the moſt unreaſonable of Women, ſhe would become the Sweeteſt and moſt compliant, if you would confine your ſelf, as you ought, to the practice of this Duty. It is extreamly neglected now a-days in the moſt part of Chriſtian Families, to their ſhame be it ſpoken, and we have but too much reaſon to ſay with the Poet,
<q>Heu pietas!<note place="margin">Virg. Aen. 6</note> Heu priſca fides!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Above all, Sir, a man ought to live in a good underſtanding with his wife, and to agree well together in relation to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick affairs. In the little ſtate of a Family, as well as in the great State of the Republick, concord is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for its ſubſiſtence. By that, ſays <hi>Saluſt,</hi> the leaſt things become great, and without it the greateſt are of no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. <hi>Concordiâres parvae creſcunt. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiâ maximae dilabuntur.</hi> When a Husband and Wife miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand one another,<note place="margin">Sal. in Jug.</note> and each fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his own caprice or deſign, all is loſt, the family falls of courſe. This
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:108454:125"/>is called in our Proverbial Language to <hi>Light a Candle at both Ends.</hi> If you don't inſtruct your Wife in your affairs, and manage all things without her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation, ſhe will eaſily be perſwaded of one of theſe two things. Either ſhe will believe that you are Rich, when perhaps you are poor: Or ſhe will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin that you are poor, when it may be you are Rich. This double error will make her fall into a double exceſs. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe will become Prodigal, and be at a hundred ſorts of vain and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table expences: Or ſhe will become co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, and ſpare even what's neceſſary. Both will be equally inconvenient for you. To avoid which, impoſe upon your ſelf this Law of accounting to her your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. Let her know from time to time the terms you are in with Fortune. Undertake nothing of moment without her advice. It is both juſt and advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for you to do ſo. For what end have the Laws and cuſtoms eſtabliſhed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of goods between Husbands and Wives, but to inform us, that as both ought to contribute their utmoſt cares to make it good, ſo it is juſt that the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands who are maſters thereof, ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:108454:126"/>their Wives of the good or evil, the loſs or the advantage of it. Is it not a thing which regards them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon? would it be reaſonable for them to be always ignorant of their own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs? and can they bear with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Husbands, whoſe ſingle aim is to hold them perpetually in ignorance, to deceive them, and to conceal all things from them? it is not to be admired at, if they find themſelves miſtaken, and if their wives practiſe on their ſide ſuch methods as diſpleaſe them. Let a wife be never ſo patient and eaſy, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to bear for ever with a Husband, who uſes her like a <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Moor,</hi> and not as his wife, but as his Servant. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaid, that it was for his advantage to treat her otherwiſe, and to diſcover to her the whole bottom of his heart and his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>airs. In effect, beſides that this will pleaſe her, and that ſhe will find her ſelf obliged to a Husband that has ſo much complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance for her, ſhe will learn by this means to regulate her expences, and to manage her ſelf after a manner proportion'd to the condition of the family. What is more important, and deſerves more applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than the practice of this Precept?</p>
            <pb n="247" facs="tcp:108454:126"/>
            <p> But this is enough concerning the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods Husbands ought to practiſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their wives, in order to live hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in their Society. Now let us ſee in a few words, to the end we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this work, to what this deſign en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages them with relation to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. This, Sir, is one of the Springs, from whence as I have ſaid, proceeds to married perſons all their happineſs, or all their Misfortune. In effect, when a man has Children, that ſeem to be well born, and in whom appear the marks of a true wiſdom, as miſerable as he is, and how great ſoever rheir number is, he finds therein the motives of a very ſweet conſolation. On the other ſide, what is more afflicting than to have ſuch as are vicious, and of unwiſe conduct? <hi>Solomon</hi> aſſures us of both; <hi>Filius ſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi> ſays he, <hi>laetiſicat Patrem. Filius ſtul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus dolor eſt Patris.</hi> A wiſe Son rejoices the Father, the fooliſh Son is the grief of the Father.</p>
            <p>From thence you may judge of what importance education is, and how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary it is to give Children a good one. <hi>Educatio &amp; diſciplina mores facit,</hi> ſays <hi>Seneca. Plutarch</hi> regards it as a new birth,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:108454:127"/>which we take in the boſom of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> puts thoſe Maſters, who have taught us the art of living well in the rank of thoſe to whom we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acquit our ſelves of the obligation, <hi>Magiſtris, Diis, &amp; Parentibus non poteſt reddi aequivalens.</hi> They are all equally reaſonable. For if it be true, that <hi>Praemium virtutis eſt bona inſtitutio,</hi> it neceſſarily follows, both that Education is whats ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable for men, and that we are no leſs obliged to our fathers for having given us a good one, than for our life it ſelf; and that we can never ſhew ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment enough. 'Tis a great deal, I confeſs, to have received a being, but I dare affirm that it is infinitely more to have received a good one. Birth gives us one common with beaſts: But 'tis education that preſents us with the other, and which renders us in ſome kind, like to the Angels.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, if a good Education be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry important with relation to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it is no leſs in regard of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. If it be to the one a principle of wiſdom, it is one of good fortune to the others. As I have ſaid, a Father cannot
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:108454:127"/>be happy, if his Children be unwiſe. The one is a neceſſary ſtep to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. From whence appears the indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible obligation of a Father to ſacrifice with pleaſure his cares and his ſubſtance for the inſtruction of his Children, and the forming of them to good manners. When he has the advantage of ſucceeding herein, he taſts in Marriage that felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which I have ſpoken of in my firſt part: that is to ſay, what is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and delightful in the World.</p>
            <p>All Fathers, 'tis true, are not in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to advance their Children to Sciences, nor capable of teaching them themſelves. I confeſs, this is a misfortune for both. I know very well that Sciences are not abſolutely neceſſary to bring men to the habits of wiſdom. They may be obtained, I grant, without them. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it muſt be agreed on, that they may be of great uſe towards it, and that Philoſopher, doubtleſs, had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to place in the number of thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Subjects he had to thank God for, that he was a Philoſopher. In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, there is much leſs corruption amongſt the Learned, than amongſt others. Their
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:108454:128"/>vice is leſs in the heart, than in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and it conſiſts more in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion than in action. As imperfect as knowing men are, they always make appear in their conduct ſome degrees of honeſty, which diſtinguiſh them to advantage. If knowledge has corrupted men, it has been by accident, after the ſame manner that the Sun infects com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sinks and Carcaſſes. It has been often abuſed, I confeſs, but in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom nothing is beter of it ſelf. Would to God, ſaid <hi>Moſes,</hi> that all theſe People were Prophets! There is not a Father but ought to make the ſame wiſh for his Children, to deſire they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Learned, and to uſe his laſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to obtain them this advantage, as the greateſt of all goods.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, Sir, that to ſucceed well in the Education of Children, one muſt go in the midſt of two oppoſite extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and preſerve a juſt temper between ſeverity and indulgence. Love and Fear ought to divide the whole chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Education on the childrens ſide, as correction and inſtruction on the fathers. If you give them too large a freedom,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:108454:128"/>they will deſpiſe you: If you allow them none they will hate you. If you have too much indulgence for them, they will become licentious: If you are too auſtere, they will be too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. In a word, if you make appear too much ſweetneſs in your conduct, theirs will be extreamly looſe. On the other ſide, if you never look upon them but with an angry eye, you make them vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, extravagant, and inſenſible of all your Exhortations. You ſee then how neceſſary it is to joyn theſe two things together in paternal diſcipline. A Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought in ſome meaſure to imitate God herein, of whom the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſays, <hi>That in the midſt of his chaſtiſements he always thinks of Mercy.</hi> The Father, 'tis true, is the ſovereign Magiſtrate of his Family, and as ſuch he ought to try his children, and puniſh them when he finds them guilty. But if he condemns them as a Judge, he ought to chaſtiſe them as a Father, that is to ſay, with huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and emotions of Love.</p>
